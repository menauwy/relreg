{"source": "we are constantly having to order and ship things over from NZ; the UK; the US as they are not available here. We end up paying way too much in shipping charges but you just cannot get the products here of the appropriate quality and any time you are looking for something specific you can never find it as the choice is extremely limited. Just recently it was toddler car seats and only today we have ordered a wooden playpen online from NZ to ship here as we cannot find a lightweight one in Qatar. We are constantly getting our family to buy and send us baby products from NZ which we cannot get here. So definitely bring whatever you can including medicines; homeopathic remedies if you use them (as they are not available at all here); skin care treatments etc. You can always sell old toys/things once the kids grow out of them or before you leave again - particularly if they are good quality items! Yes - bring as much stuff as you can for the kids. Bring shoes for yourself - sandals - shoe shopping no that great here. Go to Briscoes for super king sheets and king size single sheets. One of the most important things to get; unless you actually enjoy sleeping on a concrete slab; is a mattress topper - like a foam/latex pad to go directly on top of your matresses. I suffered for a few months before managing to find one here but it took a bit of hassle and homework first. Bring one if you can so that you have it straight away. We didn't bring a vacuum cleaner and find we don't need one; the tiled floors get swept and mopped.Lots of my daughter's dvds don;t work here - wrong zone. Our tv worked here - bring yours if want to. I totally agree with EmmaS and Intlxpatr. I'm sooo glad we brought a huge stock of kids' books and toys - it was definitely worth it. I wish we'd brought more stuff with us when we came from NZ last year; don't have any advice re kids stuff but here's what I wish I'd known. *Bring cushion covers; knick-knacks; throws; and art; the furniture selection here is dismal but even worse is trying to find the little things. Depending on your taste you may be ok but if for example you like really simple contemporary things you're out of luck. We struggled to find things like a plain shower curtain; or a plain white dinner set. definitely bring cutlery! *Don't bring Duvet covers; the duvets here are sized differently and won't fit them. You probably won't need to bring sheets either (you'll end up with a king or super king bed) *Bring books (incl kids books) there are no good bookshops here *Bring a box of bits and pieces; things like craft knife; quick-unpick; tape; tapemeasure; vivids...etc you can buy all these things here but not necc at the same shop; I bought a box of random office stuff and I'm so glad i did! *If you br..... It largely depends where you will live. If you are on a compound; many kids ride their bikes & skateboards inside the compounds. The electronic items; I would definitely bring because they will be much more expensive here. Good Luck with your move. If you have a generous shipping allowance; ship everything that matters to you and especially to your children. If you have special hobbies; ship any tools or items specific to that hobby - for example; quilters cannot buy batting in Qatar; or only rarely. Many children's toys are available very cheaply in Qatar; made in China; many break quickly or don't work properly. If you will live on a compound; a bike is a fun thing to have; but biking on the streets in Qatar is a hair-raising and life-threatening experience. Bring books. Bring anything that will make your life more homey and that will bring you comfort. Bring things you love but can leave behind or sell when leaving Qatar; knowing you can replace them back home. As Emma said; you can buy just about anything; but you may not like your choices. There is a lot of cheap - and ugly - stuff available; but quality is rare and may be priced two or three times higher than at home. On the other hand; there are European appliances which s..... My suggestion is that if you can fit toys in with your other effects without huge expense then anything you can bring that will keep them entertained here is a good thing - and will save you time and effort trying to duplicate it all after you arrive. Actually your children probably won't want to spend much time on their bikes and skateboards during the hot summer months here; and depending on where you will be living; it might be difficult to find somewhere in your neighbourhood for them to ride around safely too. By the way; while you're packing; I would be tucking a big jar of vegemite into a spare corner (if your kids like it) as it is very hard to find here and the few 150gm jars I have ever seen here cost a bomb! Hope this helps. No worries; All you need to do is assess how much it would cost to bring your stuff down.

Well I don't believe it has anything to do with the health care issue. First of all HMC only treats for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be residents not visitors; if you don't have a health card you'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergencies. Second thought let us say it was really all about health care issues and not providing the emergency cases for free to sick elders who are none residents then simply the sponsor could be asked to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payments for a visiting relative; or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee; instead of simply not allowing the elderly -who should be treated with more respect honestly- to enter. After all what's the median age of the parents of working residents here? 40? I don't think so. But as some people say it's their roof; their country; let them do with it what ever they want.

It will not be the same for someone from Asia. They should approach the concerend Officers to special approvl for it.

You cannot change employer for the first two years which is normally the minimum contract period. You can change employer only (after you finished your two year contract) if your previous employer issues you a NOC or no objection certificate.

{"source": "Exit permit is not necessary if your daughter is traveling; but for your son it's a must! HI-Roeland... the cost for one exit is 10Qrs thats the governmet fees. And the fees for multiple exit is 500Qrs; this also from the govt. Usually one exit is more than enough for a normal employee and probably if he/she needs more travelling your sponsor can issue the exit when ever you needs it. And one important thing; if you are vanishing all of a sudden doing any illegal activities without the knowledge of the sponsor; he will be in trouble after you leave. So if you are contacting the sponsor each time for exit; he can ensure there is no complaints; bank loans; huge telephone bills; accident issues; over due in salary etc etc etc. Its highly adviceable for those who are into the field of business or frequent flyers... Its a matter of trust. And if you are flying atleast 30 times an year; you can say I need multiple exit. else its waste of money only. Hope the doubt is clear... Mana; not everybody needs exit permit. If you have multiple entry visa there is no need for exit permit. Most people unfortunately do need exit permit. It's like keeping somebody hostage... sad but true. you only need an exit permit once you have got a Residence Permit (RP). The exit permit is given to you by your RP sponsor. It can be issued per trip; however; i advise you to get a one year multi exit. nope - no need for exit permit for your hubby and kids if they're on your sponsorship To my understanding of the sponsoring rules; since you are under husband's sponsorship No you do not need any exit permit. Regards!! No; you dont need any exit permit as you are in your husband's sponsorship. Pick up your passport and you may travel without any documents required. Muhammad Yousaf If u have smart id card and e gov is activated . Then you can do the exit permit anywhere in the workd provided you have e gov software in your Pc or Laptop alongwith card reader ........I always do that ....... Though i havent tried it being abroad .... you don't need a NOC. But to leave Qatar you need an exit permit from your sponsor. You have 7 days... You left it a bit late to resign; no? If you are due to go home they have to give you a ticket. If not; then go to the Labour Department and report him. If so then resign and leave. Or else convince your sponsor that you would be back. If here on work visa; One can't leave the country without exit permit. No other way. get an exit permit application form and sign it before you are going on vacation and leave valid Qatari ID with your son you can go to indian embassy as the last resort family sponsored by husband doesn't need any exit permit. No on a business visa you can fly out as many times as you wish so that just might be a company thing iam on a business visa and so are three of my friends one being a south african like yourself and we fly out for weekends all the time! It could be because it is a pain in the bum and alot of paper work for them that they are saying only one exit! But if you have an emergency they you are also allowed It is needed; if he is travelling without the sponsor ( in this case; if the father + son fly together; no need ) Your biggest problem being you have a south african passport my friend is in the same boat! If you are on a business visa then the answer is yes if you want to leave the country you HAVE to have a exit visa if you are on a visit visa then no you do not but you will need a visa to get into Dubai! A son does NOT need an exit visa if he is travelling with the father but travelling without the father he does need it. A daughter never requires an exit visa. I know this - I've done it dozens of times. get the QR500 permit; its worth it! Especially the freedom. Yes! Yes You need it. NOPE...NOT Needed at all...:) NOPE ; wife and kids under husbands sponsorship doesnt need exit permit You just go down to immigration in Al gharaffa or the airport office with your ID and your sons Id and passport and ask for a multiple exit permit for 1 year. My husband has one and it is so easy.you then pay a fee and Voila. No problems! You have your get out of jail free card anytime you want within that year. as others have said the only way is to resign my man!! Rheisalyn; One option is to exit Qatar the process all depends on the company's PRO and availability of approved visa.. Max. number of days not more than three. You also have an option of not exiting the country; business visa can be transferred while you are still in the country.. Yes; arrange him an exit permit from airport immigration before hand; it's a compulsion even you're the sponsor. You don't need to exit. Just get an NOC from the sponsor that got you the business visa along with the new one to Immigration Dept at Gharaffa. I believe you need to fill a form (not sure now). Your new employer will pay to transfer sponsorship. Just ask your mandoob or your new employer for details. But I'm sure you do not need to exit the country before being issued an RP for sure. Alexam is wrong. Perhaps he doesn't have male children above 18 yrs old. My advise is to get a multi exit permit; which cost you only QAR 500; but saves you a ton of headache. No need for any form to fill; just take your son's passport; your ID; and go to the airport immigration dept; and make sure to clearly ask for multiple-exit permit option to the person processing your request. NO exit is required give your boss a resignation letter.... Anybody above 18 who is under father's sponsorship is REQUIRED an exit permit. It's the new law implemented recently. So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit! Also make sure they have done your business visa before you fly out so it is sorted for when you land! There is no exit permit required for family dependents. He can exit anytime with or without you. \"No need any paper as u r under your husbands sponsership.You can see this information on http://portal.www.gov.qa under exit permit section. It is written that: \"\"All residents except wives and children under the sponsorship of their family members are required to obtain an exit permit when leaving Qatar.

I just wanted to share my experience with you. I ordered 5 bottles of acai berry health supplement; and it took 6 days to arrive at my office. from: www.acaiberryboutique.com I took the supplements to my physician and doctor; she also uses the same supplement (acai berry pure) for her health. She had never ordered online; instead she used to buy them when she was in the US or have friends bring them over. She compared the stuff I got from the acai berry boutique (the online store) to the stuff she got in stores in the States; and she said the quality was MUCH better from the online store. We both read a lot of blogs and articles before buying online. There are lots of ways to check quality (color; taste; feel; texture; density etc) and my doctor said the online stuff was significantly better. She is also recommending it to her patients now for things like joint pain; inflammation; digestive system; and healthier body shape. I would also recommend you buy the product online; because it is higher quality than what you can get in stores here; and in most places in the States. They ship very quickly for a site located in America; and the prices are very good for such a supplement.

Family visit visa (when you were sponsored by one of your family member)initially is valid for 1 month; and can be extended later for another 5 months (total 6 months stay) after undergoing Medical examination. Tourist visit visa is is valid for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days ; 60 days stay in total. Consume olive oil regularly; hopefully your scars will be healed miraculously Insha Allah! fIRST-When your wife came to Qatar; I guess she has a Medical from Medical Commision; you can still use that if it shows FIT..just bring the MC no.. to room 118 mEDICAL cOMMISSION for renewal with the new Visa. Second Option-Ensure that the new Work Visa profession is not food Hadlier; parlor...if not so; The Employer should make a Waiver Letter (you can get draft sample at Medical Commission Rm 118) stating that the employer is willing to hire your wife...The Medical Commission will issue a Referal Letter(Subject to MC Committee Approval) to Rumaillah Hammad Hospital for 6 months treatment..there is no problem about the expire of stamp visa..MC is informing the CIED for that Matter... Third Option- You can sponsor your wife if you are entiltled..same procedure;make a waiver letter to Medical Commission...she can work anywhere with your Waiver NOC. Al Rumaillah Hospital is specialized in this kind of thing..one of our workers has the same problem and was treated there. Our company duly assist him during his recuperation and after the treatment (it took six months) upon recommendation by RH..he was given the necessary working visa. If her company is willing to assist; then she might not encounter much trouble about it. you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six months; but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 months limit; you can do that; too. i think upto 1 month; more. you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking details. As far as I know and from my experience in our company; a husband cannot get his wife a residency unless after 6 months of stay in Doha; since one of the required documents fo the Immigration is a 6-month bank statement in order to get a Family Residence; or 3-month statement for a Family Visit Visa (valid for 6 months only). In other terms; unless you are sponsored by a company you cannot get a residence untill after six months from your husband's. the toursit visa; suggested supra (going to Dubai every 2 months) would be the only solution... After the meidcal test; next step is finger printing which can be done within 2 days after the medical test done if the result is positive ... And after finger printing within 2;3 days you can apply for RP. After 6 months you can get an extension also....", "query": "Medical Problem any Solution?", "target": "My wife is here in Doha came on Family Visit Visa extended upto 7 July 2012; She got a job so I give NOC to change to Work visa but unfortunately Medical Test reasult came UNFIT due to scar in lungs;Is there any solution for this problem?

{"source": "Noah Lerner doesn't remember hearing much about the civil rights movement when he was in public school. Now a senior at a small liberal arts college in rural Washington state Lerner aims to ensure some students learn more about a key moment in America's history. Whitman College is partnering with the Southern Poverty Law Center a nonprofit civil rights organization based in Montgomery Ala. to help its students teach schoolchildren about the civil rights movement in Walla Walla Wash. The small city known more for its sweet onions and wine in the state's southeast corner might seem an unlikely place to engage students in the topic of racial justice: Blacks make up less than 3 percent of the population and even less at the college and Washington state sits many miles from the movement's heated center in the Deep South. But the inland Pacific Northwest has long garnered attention for white supremacist activity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just last year police rerouted a Martin Luther King Jr. parade in Spokane after a bomb was found along the original route \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the rapidly growing Latino population has raised its own concerns about civil rights. They are charged in Washington with aggravated first-degree murder accused of killing Pedersen's father and his wife in Everett sometime around Sept. 26. They are also suspected of killing 19-year-old Cody Myers in Oregon and Reginald Alan Clark 53 in Eureka Calif. White supremacist Kevin Harpham 37 was arrested in March and has pleaded guilty to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and the hate crime of placing the bomb in an effort to target minorities. He faces 27 to 32 years in prison when he is sentenced by a federal judge on Dec. 20. His ex-wife had told police that Stanbary thought Christmas was a satanic holiday and idolized white separatist Randy Weaver. The latest incident occurred last week as a house in Washougal Wash. burned to the ground while someone inside shot at firefighters to keep them away. The homeowner has been identified as a self-proclaimed white separatist. n another high-profile incident a man planted a pipe bomb along the planned route of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Spokane. The shrapnel-packed bomb was found and disabled before it could explode but the FBI said it had the potential to kill or injure many of the 2 000 marchers who included children. The family of a man who admitted he planted a bomb at Spokane's Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade is asking a federal judge to issue a lenient sentence. Family members of Kevin W. Harpham 37 described him in letters to the judge as a gentle intelligent well-liked young man whose actions puzzled them. \"I know how and what he is \" Harpham's mother Lana Harpham wrote to U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush. \"I am very proud to say he is my son. I would want no other.\" The letters are part of a package presented to the court by Harpham's defense attorneys in advance of his Nov. 30 sentencing. He faces 27 to 32 years in federal prison. Prosecutors will file their sentencing recommendation soon Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Rice said. He had no comment on the defense request for 27 years. Harpham pleaded guilty in September to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to injure people in a hate crime. Two other charges will be dismissed. Harpham was arrested in March 9 after federal investigators tracked evidence including the purchase of lead fishing weights that were laced with rat poison and packed into the bomb as shrapnel. The bomb was discovered along the parade route Jan. 17 and disarmed without exploding. There were no injuries. Harpham's attorneys wrote that a sentence of 27 years was sufficient. \"Mr. Harpham who has lived an exemplary life until recent events who has no criminal history who has been a good son brother neighbor soldier and friend deserves to have this Court take into account the good works that account for the majority of his life \" defense attorneys wrote. \"I have never seen Kevin be anything but gentle with both people and animals \" wrote his sister Carmen Harpham. The letters describe family members attempting to understand how the man they knew would leave a bomb in downtown Spokane. \"There are many things that I have heard over the past nine months regarding my brother's actions that I cannot explain \" Carmen Harpham wrote. \"While I know we do not share a common philosophy about race I am puzzled at what brought my brother to this point in his life.\" The Columbian reported the owner of the home is believed to be a self-proclaimed white separatist who was arrested in Idaho in 1995 over allegations he threatened his ex-wife. At the time of the man's arrest in Bonner County Idaho authorities confiscated more than two dozen weapons including six AK-47s and a grenade launcher according to an Associated Press story. Homer Adams worked for the owner of the Washougal home. He said the man who worked at a landscaping company was a fair boss. Adams said the man did mention Randy Weaver a white supremacist involved in a deadly confrontation with federal agents in Northern Idaho in 1992. Adams said the homeowner also seemed angry about the 1993 federal action in Waco Texas that led to the deaths of dozens of members of the Branch Davidian Church. The announcement Friday afternoon came amid news reports noting that the fire coincided with the 27th anniversary of another more well-known standoff - one that killed white supremacist Robert J. Mathews the founder of the neo-Nazi group The Order on Whidbey Island Wash. as his house burned down around him. Stanbary had a history of espousing white supremacist views according to the Southern Poverty Law Center which tracks hate groups. But investigators said Friday they did not believe the fire at his house had anything to do with the anniversary. Washougal detectives arranged with Stanbary's lawyer Tuesday that he would turn himself in on Thursday they said. Stanbary was arrested and served 90 days in jail following a standoff with sheriff's deputies in Bonner County Idaho in 1994. Authorities seized a weapons cache at his home including a grenade launcher a sawed-off shotgun and six AK-47 assault rifles. Homer Adams who worked for Stanbary at a landscaping company told the AP his boss mentioned Randy Weaver a white separatist involved in a deadly confrontation with federal agents in Idaho in 1992.

Richard Drew/AP Share this on Facebook Tweet this on Twitter Share this on Google Plus Share this on LinkedIn Print this article Email this article Increase size The arrival of Ebola in the United States this year led to an unprecedented medical response involving experimental drugs round-the-clock care and layers upon layers of protective gear. And none of it has been cheap. Nine people have been treated for the virus in the U.S. since August. Seven recovered. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center which treated one of them estimates treatment for patients diagnosed with Ebola costs $50 000 a day. Officials at the University of Nebraska Medical Center which cared for two patients put the daily cost at $30 000 and\u00a0the total\u00a0at $1.16 million for a single patient. Most patients have been hospitalized for more than two weeks. The U.S. has shown it can beat Ebola. But who will pay for the expensive care it takes to do it? It's a tough question and one that the people holding the bills seem reluctant to answer. Hospitals that have treated patients in Georgia Nebraska New York and Texas did not respond to requests for comment nor did the governors' offices of these states. NIH was forthcoming about cost of care but the feds pick up the tab for treatment there. The topic of payment came up during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this month but only briefly. The Obama administration had requested $6.18 billion in emergency funding for Ebola response efforts in the U.S. Missing from the request said Sen. Mike Johanns was funding that would cover treatment of patients with Ebola on American soil. The federal government should cover the University of Nebraska Medical Center's costs he said because it had asked the medical facility to take in patients. \"We were glad to do it \" said the Republican lawmaker from Nebraska. \"But it seems at this point some assistance in terms of reimbursement would be appropriate because treating an Ebola patient is worlds different than treating Mike Johanns who walks in with a severe case of the flu.\" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that conversations about payment have so far remained between hospitals and private insurers. \"To date it has not been an issue that has come to us \" she said. \"If this is something that [Congress] wants to discuss as part of this funding we're happy to entertain that.\" Sen. Barbara Mikulski D-Md. the Senate Appropriations Committee chair agreed with Johanns about exploring federal reimbursement options. \"It is costly \" she said at the hearing referring to Ebola treatments. But neither the committee nor the panelists had a real solution. \"Let's talk about this. Let's keep working on it.\" Some hospitals faced with these costs are tentatively looking to the feds to foot the bill. New York City health officials\u00a0said\u00a0earlier this month that Bellevue Hospital's treatment of one patient with Ebola was expected to be so expensive that they would seek federal funding to help pay the bills. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta which treated four patients has asked Congress to approve funding for full reimbursement for Ebola cases. One case they said can cost up to $1 million. \"Caring for patients with Ebola virus disease effectively and safely is enormously resource-consuming far above and beyond usual care \" the hospital wrote\u00a0in a letter\u00a0to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Nov. 7. Emory officials said payment should be a collaborative effort using both federal and private sources. At the time of this writing there are no reported cases of Ebola in the U.S. But federal health officials have said that as long as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa\u2014which has\u00a0infected\u00a0more than 15 300 people and killed 5 459 of them\u2014rages on there could be more patients. And those patients most likely won't be able to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills on their own. Start with a $100 000 order for more personal protective equipment than usual and the price quickly mounted when the University of Kansas Hospital last week cared for a possible Ebola patient. Add about $8 000 to $10 000 worth of heavy plastic sheeting and materials used to seal off the isolation area from the rest of the hospital. Count in nursing overtime. Tally extra costs for hazardous waste removal. Figure in communication costs to handle the media. And note that an entire seven-bed intensive care unit \u2014 which usually would have been filled with other patients \u2014 was devoted to the care of just one person.\u201cThere were major categories of costs and expenses above and beyond what we\u2019d necessarily have for any other patient \u201d said Chris Ruder vice president of patient care services at the hospital. The Kansas City Kan. Ebola scare which turned out to be more of an infectious disease practice event gave the hospital a clear window into the cost of best-practice care for the infectious and often fatal disease. By using equipment and procedures that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since said are the right things to do KU Hospital had an expensive 48-hour experience. The full bill isn\u2019t known but a recap of those stressful days hints at what any medical center might face if a possible Ebola sufferer comes to its doors.\u201cFor example everything the physicians and nurses wore when they went into the patient\u2019s room was completely disposable \u201d Ruder said. \u201cAnd we had six nurses at any one time taking care of that one patient \u2014 a twelvefold increase in nursing care instead of the usual one nurse taking care of two patients in the ICU \u2014 plus physicians and a dedicated infectious disease team. The ratio of human resource to one patient was exorbitantly higher.\u201dThe expensive airtight protective suits hoods gloves and respirators could only be worn for two to four hours at a stretch before the workers became drenched in sweat. The hospital even bought underwear socks and booties in all sizes for the workers to wear because they also had to be disposed of after each two- to four-hour service time. Separately the International Association of Fire Fighters calculated an average cost of $382.31 for one set of personal protective equipment that would be considered adequate for a first responder to handle a possible Ebola victim. The association points out that the protective suit\u2019s cost doesn\u2019t begin to consider extra costs for throwing away a gurney mattress blankets or anything else that may carry the virus after a sufferer is transported in an ambulance. Nor does it figure the expense of disinfecting care providers equipment or vehicles. Ruder noted that major hospitals already prepared to handle infectious disease have many materials and facilities such as negative-airflow rooms already on hand. But the emergency construction of separate caregiving zones outside the patient\u2019s isolation room required a temporary sealed tunnel of plastic sheeting and creation of anterooms for workers to put on and take off protective gear and move to the shower.\u201cWe\u2019ve even replaced the ceiling tiles in our negative-airflow rooms with nonporous Sylvia Mathews Burwell the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services issued a spending plan on Thursday for the nearly $2.8 billion in Ebola funding allocated by Congress though the plan is too short on detail to know if New York will receive the money advocates have called for. The majority of the money\u2014$1.77 billion\u2014will go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of that $1.2 billion will go overseas to help combat the epidemic in West Africa with support for programs such as labs infection control and waste management. The rest of the C.D.C. money will be used for domestic initiatives such as preparing states to respond to an Ebola case paying for quarantines that were put in place and worker training. Burwell was directed to provide a detailed spending plan 30 days after Congress' $1.1 trillion spending plan became law. That deadline is today but Burwell's proposal provides only top-line numbers. just a small number of patients making up a large portion the nation's medical expenses targeting these \"high risk\" groups is vital to controlling healthcare costs and reducing utilization. This webinar will examine how health plans are working with hospitals and physician practices to manage these patient populations. poll reveals that healthcare costs access to care and Ebola are the top three concerns of Americans. Gallup has measured public perceptions of the leading U.S. health problem annually since 1999. This year's results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey conducted in early November. At the time of the new survey only one of the four people who had been diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. was still being treated and the other two surviving patients had already been declared virus-free. Gallup researchers said that it is a testament to the gravity of the Ebola virus that it still sparks relatively high public concern several weeks after the peak of the U.S. scare. meanswhile are calling on hospitals and healthcare providers to have their backs in case of a worsening outbreak according to\u00a0USA Today. \"Nurses (everywhere) are more at risk for contracting it because they are taking care of the patient with hands-on intimate contact \" National Nurses United (NNU) Co-president Deborah Burger said. NNU\u00a0has vocally advocated for hospitals to better prepare nurses to handle Ebola patients. Ebola concerns will likely increase respect for nurses as the vital role they play--and the risks they deal with--become clear clinical nurse Theresa Brown R.N. wrote for CNN citing the two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who contracted the disease caring for Thomas Eric Duncan the first patient diagnosed with the virus in America. In an effort to contain the deadly virus National Coordinator for Health IT Karen DeSalvo\u00a0will leave her post immediately to serve as Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell's acting assistant secretary for health according to\u00a0FierceHealthIT. DeSalvo will help HHS address \"pressing health issues including becoming a part of the department's team responding to Ebola \" a spokesman for her office told\u00a0FierceHealthIT.

Fielded October 8-14 during which time a nurse in Dallas became the second patient diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.1 the survey finds that Ebola tops the list of news stories followed by the public this month with U.S. airstrikes against Islamic militants the only other story garnering similar levels of attention. While the vast majority of the public knows the basics of how the virus is transmitted \u2013 \u00c2 through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is sick with Ebola \u2013 fewer are aware that a person with Ebola must be showing symptoms in order to be contagious. Nearly two-thirds say they are at least somewhat worried the U.S. will see a large number of Ebola cases and about four in ten are worried that they or a family member will contract the disease. Still a majority believes the most likely scenario is that Ebola will be contained to a small number of cases in the U.S. and most trust their local state and federal health authorities to prevent Ebola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spread. Most Americans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including majorities of Republicans Democrats and Independents \u00e2\u0080\u0093 think the U.S. should play a major role in addressing the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Majorities support the U.S. providing financial aid medical supplies and personnel and fewer but still a majority support sending troops and military personnel to fight Ebola in Africa with the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top two reasons for providing such support being to protect the health of Americans and to save lives in the African countries affected. The public is divided about whether the U.S. government is doing enough to fight Ebola abroad and at home. Attention To News News coverage of Ebola in Africa and the U.S. topped the list of closely-followed news stories this month. Seven in ten (69 percent) say they followed news about the diagnosis of the first Ebola case in the U.S. \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairly\u00e2\u0080\u009d closely and nearly as many report closely following the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (63 percent similar to 62 percent last month). Close attention is somewhat heightened on the home front with a larger share saying they followed the first U.S. Ebola case \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\u00e2\u0080\u009d closely (32 percent) compared with the outbreak in West Africa (24 percent).

The cost of treating Ebola patients at Nebraska Medical Center's biocontainment unit averaged $30 000 a day according to Jeffrey Gold M.D. chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center who testified Tuesday during a House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing. In the end Gold estimated it cost the hospital than $1 million to treat two Ebola patients at the Nebraska Medical Center. Those are the direct costs the Washington Post reported and doesn't include the cost of taking 10 beds out of service--a figure he estimates is close to $148 000.

MORE ITEMS Effect on the Life and Health Insurance Industries The effects on the Life and Health insurance industries will clearly depend on whether the infected people are insured. Some of those who have died up to now were children and almost certainly did not have life insurance. Even if the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens or even hundreds of thousands of adults in Africa it is not likely to trigger many life insurance or health insurance claims there. Life insurance coverage in the three most affected countries\u00e2\u0080\u0094Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone\u00e2\u0080\u0094is extremely low. Indeed in Swiss Re\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent report on life premiums per capita (for 2013) the calculation for all three of these countries is so small that none makes the list. Even in the unlikely event that the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens of thousands of adults in the United States the financial impact will likely be quite manageable. This is because perhaps one-third of adults in the U.S. have life insurance only through their employment and the amount is typically equal to one year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income. Another one-third have individual life insurance with the average death benefit in the $200 000 range. In a typical year life insurers pay about 2 million death claims so another 100 000 would be only 5 percent more than typical. Moreover most life insurers are well capitalized and even the largest life insurers have reinsurance to prevent a surge in death claims from imperiling their solvency so that the net effect would likely be at most a reduction in the profit they would otherwise record. The cost of caring for Ebola cases would likely be at the high end of health insurance claims and the effect on health insurers would depend on the number of people suspected of being infected. Many people would need to be tested to see whether they have contracted the virus and the cost of isolation of those affected could be substantial. Note that some individuals may have no health insurance as was the case with the index (first) patient who died of Ebola at a Dallas hospital on October 8. In such cases treatment costs will likely be borne outside the private health insurance system. will have an impact on the front end with the newness.

The hospital even bought underwear socks and booties in all sizes for the workers to wear because they also had to be disposed of after each two- to four-hour service time. Separately the International Association of Fire Fighters calculated an average cost of $382.31 for one set of personal protective equipment that would be considered adequate for a first responder to handle a possible Ebola victim. The association points out that the protective suit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t begin to consider extra costs for throwing away a gurney mattress blankets or anything else that may carry the virus after a sufferer is transported in an ambulance. Nor does it figure the expense of disinfecting care providers equipment or vehicles. Ruder noted that major hospitals already prepared to handle infectious disease have many materials and facilities such as negative-airflow rooms already on hand. But the emergency construction of separate caregiving zones outside the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s isolation room required a temporary sealed tunnel of plastic sheeting and creation of anterooms for workers to put on and take off protective gear and move to the shower. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve even replaced the ceiling tiles in our negative-airflow rooms with nonporous tiles \u00e2\u0080\u009d Ruder said. new Gallup poll reveals that healthcare costs access to care and Ebola are the top three concerns of Americans. Gallup has measured public perceptions of the leading U.S. health problem annually since 1999. This year's results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey conducted in early November. At the time of the new survey only one of the four people who had been diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. was still being treated and the other two surviving patients had already been declared virus-free. Gallup researchers said that it is a testament to the gravity of the Ebola virus that it still sparks relatively high public concern several weeks after the peak of the U.S. scare. Article model the University of Kansas Hospital tried to replicate in a hurry when it got its first suspected Ebola patient turned up in early October. The Kansas City Kansas hospital emptied out a seven-bed patient care unit and quickly put up $10 000 worth of temporary walls and heavy plastic sheeting to create an isolation suite. It included sealed tunnels that caregivers could use to move between the patient\u2019s room and a decontamination area. The hospital even stockpiled shoes and undergarments for doctors and nurses who were told to dispose of every stitch as hazardous waste during decontamination. It took less than 48 hours to determine that the patient didn\u2019t have Ebola but since then even more light construction has been done to make it easier to ramp arrival of Ebola in the United States this year led to an unprecedented medical response involving experimental drugs round-the-clock care and layers upon layers of protective gear. And none of it has been cheap. Nine people have been treated for the virus in the U.S. since August. Seven recovered. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center which treated one of them estimates treatment for patients diagnosed with Ebola costs $50 000 a day. Officials at the University of Nebraska Medical Center which cared for two patients put the daily cost at $30 000 and\u00a0the total\u00a0at $1.16 million for a single patient. Most patients have been hospitalized for more than two weeks. The U.S. has shown it can beat Ebola. But who will pay for the expensive care it takes to do it?It's a tough question and one that the people holding the bills seem reluctant to answer. Hospitals that have treated patients in Georgia Nebraska New York and Texas did not respond to requests for comment nor did the governors' offices of these states. NIH was forthcoming about cost of care but the feds pick up the tab for treatment there. The topic of payment came up during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this month but only briefly. The Obama administration had requested $6.18 billion in emergency funding for Ebola response efforts in the U.S. Missing from the request said Sen. Mike Johanns was funding that would cover treatment of patients with Ebola on American soil. The federal government should cover the University of Nebraska Medical Center's costs he said because it had asked the medical facility to take in patients.\"We were glad to do it \" said the Republican lawmaker from Nebraska. \"But it seems at this point some assistance in terms of reimbursement would be appropriate because treating an Ebola patient is worlds different than treating Mike Johanns who walks in with a severe case of the flu.\"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that conversations about payment have so far remained between hospitals and private insurers. \"To date it has not been an issue that has come to us \" she said. \"If this is something that [Congress] wants to discuss as part of this funding we're happy to entertain that.\"Sen. Barbara Mikulski D-Md. the Senate Appropriations Committee chair agreed with Johanns about exploring federal reimbursement options. \"It is costly \" she said at the hearing referring to Ebola treatments. But neither the committee nor the panelists had a real solution. \"Let's talk about this. Let's keep working on it.\"Some hospitals faced with these costs are tentatively looking to the feds to foot the bill. New York City health officials\u00a0said\u00a0earlier this month that Bellevue Hospital's treatment of one patient with Ebola was expected to be so expensive that they would seek federal funding to help pay the bills. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta which treated four patients has asked Congress to approve funding for full reimbursement for Ebola cases. One case they said can cost up to $1 million.\"Caring for patients with Ebola virus disease effectively and safely is enormously resource-consuming far above and beyond usual care \" the hospital wrote\u00a0in a letter\u00a0to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Nov. 7. Emory officials said payment should be a collaborative effort using both federal and private sources. At the time of this writing there are no reported cases of Ebola in the U.S. But federal health officials have said that as long as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa\u2014which has\u00a0infected\u00a0more than 15 300 people and killed 5 459 of them\u2014rages on there could be more patients. And those patients most likely won't be able to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills on their own. December 1 2014 | By Zack Budryk Despite progress in containing Ebola in the United States some hospitals are reluctant to treat new cases because of the potential cost and stigma of caring for patients who have the deadly virus the Washington Post reports. no one predicted the cost of the prep as well as treatment of patients with the virus. The cost of treating Ebola patients at Nebraska Medical Center's biocontainment unit averaged $30 000 a day according to Jeffrey Gold M.D. chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center who testified Tuesday during a House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing. In the end Gold estimated it cost the hospital than $1 million to treat two Ebola patients at the Nebraska Medical Center. Those are the direct costs the Washington Post reported and doesn't include the cost of taking 10 beds out of service--a figure he estimates is close to $148 000. The hospital is still waiting for reimbursement but Gold urged Congress to approve funding to cover reimbursement for the cost of care that insurance doesn't provide. With just a small number of patients making up a large portion the nation's medical expenses targeting these high risk groups is vital to controlling healthcare costs and reducing utilization. This webinar will examine how health plans are working with hospitals and physician practices to manage these patient populations. That's the model the University of Kansas Hospital tried to replicate in a hurry when it got its first suspected Ebola patient turned up in early October. The Kansas City Kansas hospital emptied out a seven-bed patient care unit and quickly put up $10 000 worth of temporary walls and heavy plastic sheeting to create an isolation suite. It included sealed tunnels that caregivers could use to move between the patient's room and a decontamination area. The hospital even stockpiled shoes and undergarments for doctors and nurses who were told to dispose of every stitch as hazardous waste during decontamination. It took less than 48 hours to determine that the patient didn't have Ebola but since then even more light construction has been done to make it easier to ramp up in the future. The world is facing a water and sanitation crisis with 2.5 billion people on our planet lacking access to a basic toilet. The global health and economic costs are huge. However the crisis can be addressed and there is an important and growing role for private enterprise. Barbara Frost will have an impact on the front end with the newness. But long term you probably would be grateful. that a place like Presbyterian is having this experience up front. People today don't think about patients that have HIV who are in beds down the hallway. If you want a sound bite it's this: We'll soon realize this is part of the global environment that nothing is restrained by political boundaries. Healthcare providers have a responsibility and a calling and the ability and capacity to respond to this new world that we live in. The hospital that thinks that they're immune that they'll avoid a serious disease is delusional. HLM: Can you discuss the problem with the emergency room software glitch and the miscommunication about the patient's travel history? [The hospital said initially that there was a flaw in the way physicians and nurses interacted with the hospital's electronic health record system; then retracted that statement the next day.) BB: I think there was effective communication. The hospital followed CDC protocols. I'm intimately familiar with (the Epic EHR system). It's true that Epic does have modules of nursing notes and physician notes. But to say that the physician doesn't have access to the nursing notes or to say that the physician doesn't have access to nurse's notes is erroneous. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 meanswhile are calling on hospitals and healthcare providers to have their backs in case of a worsening outbreak according to\u00a0USA Today. \"Nurses (everywhere) are more at risk for contracting it because they are taking care of the patient with hands-on intimate contact \" National Nurses United (NNU) Co-president Deborah Burger said. NNU\u00a0has vocally advocated for hospitals to better prepare nurses to handle Ebola patients. Ebola concerns will likely increase respect for nurses as the vital role they play--and the risks they deal with--become clear clinical nurse Theresa Brown R.N. wrote for CNN citing the two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who contracted the disease caring for Thomas Eric Duncan the first patient diagnosed with the virus in America. In an effort to contain the deadly virus National Coordinator for Health IT Karen DeSalvo\u00a0will leave her post immediately to serve as Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell's acting assistant secretary for health according to\u00a0FierceHealthIT. DeSalvo will help HHS address \"pressing health issues including becoming a part of the department's team responding to Ebola \" a spokesman for her office told\u00a0FierceHealthIT.
