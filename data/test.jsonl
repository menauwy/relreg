Due Diligence Prior to signing of property contract; we suggest buyer to carry out a due diligence check on the developer and development on the following: the company registration certificate (if the seller is an entity) or proof of seller's identity (if the seller is a private individual) or proof of a personal who is duly authorised to sign all legal documents (if the seller is an entity or an attorney of the seller) the title certificate for the land the planning permission/consent the building licence all other relevant permissions for the commencement of the project any lien; debt; development finance; or encumbrances against the land and/or the project at least one of bank guarantee; insurance and/or assurance ensure the completion of the project or an escrow system to provide security for the buyer's property payments an independent quantity surveying (QS) system during the construction period The above due diligence check is more appropriate to be done through a local law firm or conveyancing lawyer. 4. Exchange Contract Before singing preliminary purchase contract; buyers are suggested to consult a local law firm or conveyancing lawyer on analyse the risk; any unfavourable terms of the contract. Upon signing of the contract; first instalment/payment is often required. 5.

Bring the title of the property to the archive office of the real estate registry b. Fill sale-purchase agreement that is available in the real estate registry c. The archive office registers the title information in the Archive database d. The seller takes the file from the archive office to the registrar office in the real estate registry e. The registrar office checks non-encumbrances f. The buyer pays the transfer fee at the real estate registry g.

She said she wants to renegotiate the agreement. ", "The ministry has responded to Attawapiskat's plea for help by promising to retrofit 15 homes that were originally abandoned by people who considered tents and sheds as the safer option.

Every air-conditioning system is custom designed to that vehicle.\" \n", "\n Air-conditioning makers must scramble to find economical substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, gases traditionally used as refrigerants, which were banned by the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty signed by more than 150 countries, because they deplete the earth's ozone layer. \n", "\n Since the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, the first of a series of international agreements to limit and finally ban the manufacture and use of ozone-destroying chemicals, the rate of increase in the destruction of the ozone layer has somewhat declined. \n", "\n . In 1987, 57 nations met in Montreal and adopted a treaty calling for a 50 percent reduction in the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, and other ozone-depleting chemicals. \n", "\n Environmentalists are concerned about increased use of methyl bromide, fumigant that is considered more destructive to protective ozone layer in stratosphere than some banned chemicals; under treaty known as Montreal Protocol, it was to be banned for most uses by end of 2004; but local and international politics have allowed it to elude elimination \n", "\n Under the terms of the Montreal Protocol, the use of methyl bromide was supposed to be phased out completely by January 2005. \n", "\n Anthony Lewis (column, Sept. 25) insinuates that the United States chemical industry has retreated in its support for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that will stop the production of chlorofluorocarbons by 1996. \n", "\n A 1987 agreement in Montreal to curb global use of chlorofluorocarbons -- chemicals that are believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield -- envisions trade sanctions against countries that do not abide by the new standards. \n", "\n Despite reassurances from professional groups, some patients remain uneasy. Nancy Sander, president of the Allergy and Asthma Network-Mothers of Asthmatics, a patient advocacy group with 5,000 members based in Fairfax, Va., said that the current F.D.A. proposal reflected more concern for the environment than for people with asthma. Surveys indicate that patients favor the development of new inhalers and the elimination of CFC's, she said, but they fear that the process the F.D.A. has suggested may phase out the old ones without first letting patients make sure that the new ones work as well. Ms. Sander also said patients were worried that some old medications would not be reformulated into new inhalers because of the expense of the change and would be lost from the market. ''The F.D.A. needs to continue to understand the needs of patients and to monitor them the same way the Environmental Protection Agency monitors ozone,'' she said. The proposed changes are intended to bring the United States into compliance with the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty signed by more than 150 countries to reduce CFC pollution. In keeping with the treaty, the production of the gases was banned for most nonmedical uses in the United States in 1996. Inhaled medications received an ''essential use'' exemption from the treaty because they form the cornerstone of treatment for most of the 12 million to 15 million people with asthma in the nation and a similar number with disorders like emphysema and chronic bronchitis. \n", "\n At a meeting in Montreal in September, nearly 50 nations approved an agreement calling for the production of CFC's and their use to be frozen by stages and eventually rolled back by 50 percent by the end of the century. \n", "\n An international agreement signed in 1987 called for halving chlorofluorocarbon emissions by 1999. \n", "\n But the conversion cost has come down, especially for cars built just before the changeover. Drusilla Hufford, who handles ozone issues for the Environmental Protection Agency, said many retrofittings now cost $100 to $150. \n", "\n The U.S.'s record on ozone depletion has been mixed. On the plus side, it helped produce the Montreal protocol of 1987, which mandated a 50 percent reduction in CFC's by the year 2000. \n", "\n New, legally binding restrictions on the use of chemicals now widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer, which screens out harmful radiation from the sun, will be proposed Tuesday by the Federal Government. The proposal, which will require industry first to freeze and then to roll back the production and consumption of two widely used chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons and halons, will be announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, officials said today. Industrial and developing nations agreed to control the use of the two chemicals at a meeting in Montreal in September. \n", "\n A landmark treaty to protect the earth's ozone shield came into force today as the European Community formally agreed to abide by its provisions. Now that the requisite number of nations have officially signed, nations ratifying the treaty will by the end of next year be required to freeze at 1986 levels the production and use of industrial chemicals believed to be destroying ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere. Countries adhering to the treaty, which was drafted by 42 nations in Montreal last year under the sponsorship of the United Nations Environmental Program, will also be required to cut production and use of these chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons and halons, by at least half by the end of the century. Hailed as a Major Step Many scientists, policy makers and environmentalists contend that scientific data that have emerged since the Montreal meeting show that the chemicals should be eliminated completely to protect the ozone layer from severe depletion. But they hailed the Montreal protocol, saying that it could be an important precedent for international cooperation on environmental problems like the warming of the earth caused by manmade gases in the atmosphere. \n", "\n Your Dec. 10 news article on the conclusion of the international meeting in Vienna where 149 countries met to amend the Montreal Protocol governing protection of the ozone layer did not convey the huge environmental disappointment over the weak results and the failure of United States leadership. \n", "\n Adding significance to the conference was the fact that most of the participating underdeveloped countries were not members of the Montreal Convention of 1987, which froze production levels of chlorofluorocarbons in an attempt to retard the depletion of the ozone layer, and sought to reduce production by the end of the century. \n", "\n A treaty signed in Montreal in 1987 under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program requires a 50 percent reduction in the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. \n", "\n JUST two years ago when 31 nations met in Montreal and agreed to cut the production of chlorofluorocarbons in half by the turn of the century, the accord was hailed by environmentalists as an unprecedented example of international cooperation. \n", "\n Under the Montreal Protocol of 1987, nations that produce chlorofluorocarbons are committed to cut such production by 50 percent by the end of the century to protect the ozone layer. \n", "\n Under an international treaty reached in Montreal, most of the developed nations have agreed to reduce the production of CFC's. \n", "\n Du Pont's action indicated a readiness to surpass the goals of an international agreement reached in Montreal last fall calling for an initial freeze on production levels and then a 50 percent reduction in their use by the end of the century. \n", "\n Under a protocol signed in Montreal in September 1987, those who agreed to the treaty committed themselves to a 50 percent reduction in the production and use of the chemicals by the end of the century. \n", "\n Controls were first placed on CFC production by the Montreal Protocol of 1987. \n", "\n All auto manufacturers are developing conversion kits so that systems designed for R-12 can be modified to use R-134a. Some will be relatively simple, others more complicated and expensive. Nevertheless, as R-12 becomes more scarce and costly, auto executives say the conversions will increasingly become the more economical choice. Mr. Oulouhojian said most conversion kits had not yet been developed; their prices are estimated at $200 to $800. He said costs were likely to be lower for newer cars with more modern cooling systems. The cost of completely converting an older car may not make economic sense, he said. But there may be some alternatives, like a partial conversion. \"If a customer is willing to accept air that is a few degrees hotter than in the past, the cost may be considerably lower,\" Mr. Oulouhojian said. \n", "\n In the 1980's, scientists discovered a gap in the ozone shield over Antarctica, a finding that helped convince the major industrial nations to sign a treaty in Montreal in 1987 to cut in half production of the destructive chemicals by the year 2000. \n", "\n NO global environmental problem captured the world's attention as quickly as the erosion of the ozone layer, a molecular veil that shields Earth from ultraviolet radiation. Recognition that most of the damage came from a group of synthetic chemicals -- chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's -- led in 1987 to the passage of a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, phasing out the substances. \n", "\n The U.S. persuaded the world to reach agreement on phasing out production of CFC's, a class of industrial chemicals that destroy the life-protecting layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere. Many developing countries that signed the Montreal protocol of 1987 asked for help in converting to the more costly substitutes, and Washington agreed in principle to provide it. \n", "\n Just after an international protocol to protect the earth's ozone shield was signed in Montreal in September, Secretary of State George P. Shultz telephoned Assistant Secretary John D. Negroponte to compliment him on ''an important diplomatic triumph for the United States.'' \n", "\n The United States is seeking to make more American farmers and industries exempt from an international ban on methyl bromide, a popular pesticide that damages Earth's protective ozone layer, Bush administration officials said yesterday. Last year, the administration sought to exclude a variety of farmers and food producers from the ban, which takes effect next year that outlaws substances that harm the ozone layer. The exempt businesses would be allowed 21.9 million pounds of methyl bromide next year and 20.8 million pounds in 2006 in uses like fumigating stored grain and treating golf-course sod and strawberry fields. The new request, filed with United Nations treaty administrators last weekend, would add 1.1 million pounds to the 2005 request, to be used by producers of cut flowers, processed meats and tobacco seedlings. Some American growers say methyl bromide remains vital to compete with countries where cheap laborers do weeding and pest control. Critics of the American requests said the exemptions could undermine the 1987 ozone treaty. Use of methyl bromide has been cut 70 percent in industrialized countries since 1999 under the treaty. Parties to the pact, the Montreal Protocol, are to meet this month in Montreal to consider requests by the United States and other countries. \n", "\n Like other chemicals such as CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, methyl bromide is supposed to be phased out under the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty \n", "\n Scientists estimate that methyl bromide will account for 15 percent of ozone depletion in 2000, and both environmentalists and the Bush Administration had strongly advocated curbs on its production. In practice, the new commitments under a 1987 treaty called the Montreal Protocol will not affect United States producers as much as those in some other countries, since the Bush Administration has already adopted regulations on the most important chemicals as stringent as those approved in Copenhagen. The United States did, however, commit itself to increased payments to a fund designed to aid developing countries in adopting substitutes for the ozone-depleting subtances. \n", "\n Government scientists have measured a significant drop in atmospheric levels of methyl bromide, a versatile pesticide that is being phased out of use because it damages the planet's protective ozone layer. The scientists say the drop, 13 percent since 1998, is attributable to mandatory curbs on the chemical under the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty aimed at restoring the layer, which blocks ultraviolet radiation that could otherwise raise cancer rates and harm ecosystems. \n", "\n Allied Signal Inc. has licensed a refrigerant that does not destroy the atmosphere's ozone layer to E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company for use in new air-conditioning systems. The refrigerant, called Genetron AZ-20, replaces hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22, which is scheduled to be phased out by 2010 under the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. \n", "\n The Irvine ordinance goes beyond other measures and also covers the related halons, used in fire extinguishers, and the widely used solvents carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform. It will prohibit their use in ''the manufacture, production, cleansing, degreasing or sterilization of any substance or product'' apart from the exceptions. 'Unnecessary' and 'Redundant' But while they say they support the phasing out of the use of the compounds, the producers of the chemicals say the Irvine law may undermine the orderly transition agreed to by 46 countries in Montreal in 1987. The countries agreed to put an immediate limit on production of the chemical compounds and agreed to cut it by half by 1998. \n", "\n As another example, he cites the passage of the Montreal Protocol in the late 1980s. Meant to phase out production of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons that were believed responsible for ozone depletion, it is considered one of the most successful international agreements ever. \n", "\n Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the Bush Administration's policy on controlling the emission of gases believed to contribute to global warming misstated the focus of the international accord called the Montreal Protocol. It sets a timetable for phasing out chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals associated with destruction of the earth's ozone layer; it does not cover \"greenhouse gases\" linked to global warming. \n", "\n . In 1987, representatives from 57 nations met in Montreal and adopted a treaty calling for reductions in the use of ozone-depleting chemicals and amended the agreement, with stricter controls, in a meeting in London in June 1990. \n", "\n THE rates at which two ozone-destroying gases, halon 1301 and halon 1211, are accumulating in the atmosphere have fallen by about half since 1987, when the United States and 22 other nations agreed to stop producing them by the year 2000, a study shows. The decline in emissions supports industries' claims to be on or ahead of schedule in cutting halon production to the levels mandated by an agreement called the Montreal Protocol and reflects the search for cheaper, safer alternatives, said Dr. James W. Elkins of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, who participated in the study. \n", "\n Last year, a larger group of nations attending a conference in Montreal agreed to a 50 percent cutback by the end of the century, but new evidence of damage to the ozone layer has prompted the calls for more drastic reductions. \n", "\n The first such protocol was signed in Montreal last year by 37 nations to limit production and use of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that destroy the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere. \n", "\n These are the major provisions of the protocol: * In 1989, when it takes effect, participating nations are to freeze use of chlorofluorocarbons at levels of 1986. * By 1994, the consumption must be reduced by 20 percent. * By 1999, consumption is to be cut 30 percent more, for a total of 50 percent of 1986 levels. * Use of halons, chemicals used as fire suppressants, is to be frozen at 1986 levels by 1994, but reductions would not be required. Allowance for Developing Nations \n", "\n But most of the delegates and observers here said they were optimistic that the protocol would be adopted and ratified. ''We must not fail, for nothing less than the future of the planet earth is at stake,''said Canada's Environment Minister, Tom McMillan. The proposed treaty deals with chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, chemicals used in refrigeration, air conditioning, plastic foams, aerosol sprays, cleaning agents for electronic products and a wide variety of other products. Their use in aerosol sprays has been banned in the United States. The draft protocol would freeze consumption by developed countries at 1986 levels starting Jan. 1, 1990; it would reduce consumption by 20 percent by Jan. 1, 1994, and by as much as an additional 30 percent by Jan. 1, 1999. However, the draft would allow total global production of these chemicals go up by as much as 10 percent over the next 10 years in order to meet the needs of the developing countries for industrial growth. The draft protocol would also freeze consumption of halons, chemicals used as fire supressants, by Jan. 1, 1994, but would not require any rollbacks in their use. Dire Predictions Both CFC's and halons combine chemically with and destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere. That ozone shields the earth's surface from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. \n", "\n The exemption requests, to be submitted this week to the Ozone Secretariat at the United Nations, drew criticism from environmental groups, which said the environmental agency was undermining the Montreal Protocol of 1987. The protocol is generally regarded as one of the most effective environmental pacts. With 160 signers, it set a timetable for nations to phase out compounds that damage the stratospheric ozone layer that protects Earth from ultraviolet radiation. \n", "\n As an example, Mr. Tessitore cited the Montreal Protocol, a treaty engineered by the United Nations Environment Program in 1987 that called for the reduction of chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, which damage the earth's ozone layer. \n", "\n The United States and 10 other nations agreed yesterday to reduce their requests for exemptions to a ban on methyl bromide, one of the last remaining ozone-destroying compounds being produced and used extensively in wealthy countries. The shift, at negotiations in Montreal, ended a stalemate that experts said threatened the integrity of the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 treaty eliminating chemicals that have damaged the atmosphere's protective ozone layer. \n", "\n Under an international agreement signed in Montreal in 1987, the emission of chlorofluorocarbons is to be reduced by 50 percent in the next decade by industrialized countries, and over a longer period by developing nations \n", "\n At talks on the Montreal Protocol, which restricts chemicals harmful to the ozone layer, the United States and several other countries gained permission to continue using substantial amounts of methyl bromide through 2006 despite a ban that is to take effect in wealthy countries on Jan. 1. \n", "\n The Montreal Protocol, the international agreement to curb and eventually stop the production of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, is not itself without holes. \n", "\n Scientists, government officials and legislators from the United States and Britain spoke in alarming tones about rapid depletion of the ozone layer and the contribution to the global ''greenhouse effect'' made by chlorofluorocarbons. They emphasized that the 1987 Montreal agreement to reduce them by 50 percent by the end of the century did not go far enough. \n", "\n Furthermore, it has always been generally understood that the industrialized nations would move first, the developing nations later. That was exactly the sequence adopted by the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which has been successful in controlling the chemicals that threatened the ozone layer. \n", "\n Scientists say that as more ultraviolet radiation penetrates the atmosphere, it is likely to cause an epidemic of skin cancer and cataracts, as well as damage to agriculture. Two nations, China and India, which had refused to accede to the 1987 treaty, the Montreal Protocol, were satisfied by the latest agreement. Their delegation leaders plan to recommend ratification. \n", "\n Somewhat to their surprise, those who make and use these widespread chemicals are finding that complying with a recent international treaty may be relatively painless. The treaty, negotiated last year in Montreal by 31 nations, calls for a leveling off and then a rolling back in production of the harmful chlorofluorocarbons and halons. \n", "\n A pending international treaty, the Montreal protocol, calls for a freeze in global CFC production, followed by a cut of only 50 percent. \n", "\n Under an international agreement intended to limit the damage to Earth's protective ozone layer, the production of CFC's is limited by quotas. The agreement, the Montreal Protocol of 1987, will ban the production of CFC's for most uses in developed countries at the end of this year. It will allow developing countries to continue production for 10 more years. \n", "\n As a result of the price jump, some alternatives that are seen as environmentally friendly have become more attractive.

Its success did not come from its initial 1987 controls on the use of chemicals that deplete ozone, but from its adaptability in achieving its goals.

European Community a Hurdle Halon consumption levels would be frozen by 1994, but no rollbacks are planned for these chemicals yet. The major last-minute hurdle faced by the negotiators was a demand by the European Community that its 12 member nations be treated as a single entity and that consumption limits not apply to any one member country. Mr. Thomas said the United States objected to this plan because it would give the European Community a trade advantage not enjoyed by others joining in the protocol. A compromise was reached that would allow the Community to be treated individually, but only after each member state ratified the protocol individually. \n", "\n This year's expedition, financed by Federal and private sources, coincided with an international conference in Montreal that reached an agreement to freeze and eventually reduce chlorofluorocarbon production. \n", "\n An agreement signed in Montreal last year commits industrial nations to a 50 percent reduction in the use of chlorofluorocarbons by 1999. \n", "\n ''There was no dissent at all about the fact that we are facing a real problem of depletion of the ozone,'' Dr. Tolba said.

You see the famous pictures (Mona Lisa); and spend some time looking at the amazing art. if you go on Sunday morning and get there as they're opening; it's free admission. TIP # 7 - If there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in Paris; it's in the roundabout that goes around the Arc D'Triomphe. If you rent a car and drive here; just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules. TIP #8 - There are lots of wonderful museums in France! One of them is the Pantheon; which was originally a church; and originally planned to be something other than that .Victor Hugo and some other famous French people are buried there. Make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that's something you want to do. TIP #9 - Have some small change (or large change if you can afford it) on hand for the street performers. They're pretty good! TIP #10 - If you like looking at the inside of churches; take some time for Notre' Dame; and if you have a problem with crowds; don't go on the weekend. People were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays; but there are a lot of people there on the weekends; so you end up waiting in line; and it gets more noisy inside. TIP #11 - If you want to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle at night; get there right before the hour. TIP #12 - If you see a person on the street who is selling something and wants to sketch you or give you something for free; don't be fooled by talk which says they'll so something for free. IT ISN'T FREE! __________________________________________ <b>Attitudes are more important than facts...</b>", "Few more tips; if you still haven't traveled yet. For Music visit: Palais Garnier.
