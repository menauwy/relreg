Despite the lack of data; modern day people have embraced acai berries as their next best thing to lose weight and gain a healthy body; skin and digestive system. But the truth is that acai berry benefits are overrated. Acai palm; derived from the Euterpe genre of palm cultured in the Brazilian rain forests is known to have antioxidant properties; which is true. But the antioxidants need to be as good for health as it is presented to the common man. Also; as acai berry is not directly consumed by human beings; more than half the beneficial properties of the fruit go in vain. After processing and converting the berries into supplements; it is presented in the form of dietary pills; concentrated juices; beverages; instant drinks; smoothies; yoghurts or is eaten whole as a fruit. When taken as a whole fruit; the benefits are genuine; but not otherwise. Acai berry scam has been exposed today because of the scientific data that reveals that there has not been any research or investigation about the claimed benefits of the fruit. Producers of acai supplements have presented unproven claims and declarations to people about the health benefits of the fruit and its antioxidant properties; but these are all unsubstantial claims. The truth is that acai berries have only very negligible amounts of antioxidant; which is quite less than what you can find in other types of berries and fruits. It needs to be brought to light that there are no such benefits of acai berries that scientists could have pointed out. Acai berry and products made from the same have not earned an approval from the FDA; and the potency of these products is questionable. There have been many talk shows and conferences regarding the false claims of acai berry as a weight loss supplement; yet people are simply reluctant to acknowledge the fact that acai berries are simply not acceptable according to medical and scientific terms. Many consumers of acai products have actually suffered from health complication in the recent past. It should be considered as awareness for the masses; as acai berry products have almost flooded the market today. Despite the warnings and acai berry scams revealed on the internet every other day; still there seems to be a lack of communication that needs to be bridged. Internet has had a great influence in marketing acai berry products. However; it has also contributed in revealing the acai berry scams; which people have often overlooked. As companies come up with potential free trail offers; customers fall prey to these lucrative offers and accept them. In the quest to try out these products; they often end up endangering their health. Acai berries does not have any miraculous properties; it is just like any other fruit that has not been researched or scientifically tested to have any medicinal properties. The only presence of antioxidants does not make it a weight loss product as well. Hence; prevention is advised.

This webinar will examine how health plans are working with hospitals and physician practices to manage these patient populations. Register Today! MORE ITEMS", "The arrival of Ebola in the United States this year led to an unprecedented medical response involving experimental drugs round-the-clock care and layers upon layers of protective gear. And none of it has been cheap. Nine people have been treated for the virus in the U.S. since August. Seven recovered. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center which treated one of them estimates treatment for patients diagnosed with Ebola costs $50 000 a day. Officials at the University of Nebraska Medical Center which cared for two patients put the daily cost at $30 000 and the total at $1.16 million for a single patient. Most patients have been hospitalized for more than two weeks. The U.S. has shown it can beat Ebola. But who will pay for the expensive care it takes to do it? It's a tough question and one that the people holding the bills seem reluctant to answer. Hospitals that have treated patients in Georgia Nebraska New York and Texas did not respond to requests for comment nor did the governors' offices of these states. NIH was forthcoming about cost of care but the feds pick up the tab for treatment there. The topic of payment came up during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this month but only briefly. The Obama administration had requested $6.18 billion in emergency funding for Ebola response efforts in the U.S. Missing from the request said Sen. Mike Johanns was funding that would cover treatment of patients with Ebola on American soil. The federal government should cover the University of Nebraska Medical Center's costs he said because it had asked the medical facility to take in patients. We were glad to do it said the Republican lawmaker from Nebraska. But it seems at this point some assistance in terms of reimbursement would be appropriate because treating an Ebola patient is worlds different than treating Mike Johanns who walks in with a severe case of the flu. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that conversations about payment have so far remained between hospitals and private insurers. To date it has not been an issue that has come to us she said. If this is something that [Congress] wants to discuss as part of this funding we're happy to entertain that. Sen. Barbara Mikulski D-Md. the Senate Appropriations Committee chair agreed with Johanns about exploring federal reimbursement options. It is costly she said at the hearing referring to Ebola treatments. But neither the committee nor the panelists had a real solution. Let's talk about this. Let's keep working on it. Some hospitals faced with these costs are tentatively looking to the feds to foot the bill. New York City health officials said earlier this month that Bellevue Hospital's treatment of one patient with Ebola was expected to be so expensive that they would seek federal funding to help pay the bills. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta which treated four patients has asked Congress to approve funding for full reimbursement for Ebola cases. One case they said can cost up to $1 million. Caring for patients with Ebola virus disease effectively and safely is enormously resource-consuming far above and beyond usual care the hospital wrote in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Nov. 7. Emory officials said payment should be a collaborative effort using both federal and private sources. At the time of this writing there are no reported cases of Ebola in the U.S. But federal health officials have said that as long as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa\u2014which has infected more than 15 300 people and killed 5 459 of them\u2014rages on there could be more patients. And those patients most likely won't be able to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills on their own. More from", "That's the model the University of Kansas Hospital tried to replicate in a hurry when it got its first suspected Ebola patient turned up in early October. The Kansas City Kansas hospital emptied out a seven-bed patient care unit and quickly put up $10 000 worth of temporary walls and heavy plastic sheeting to create an isolation suite. It included sealed tunnels that caregivers could use to move between the patient's room and a decontamination area. The hospital even stockpiled shoes and undergarments for doctors and nurses who were told to dispose of every stitch as hazardous waste during decontamination. It took less than 48 hours to determine that the patient didn't have Ebola but since then even more light construction has been done to make it easier to ramp up in the future.", "new Gallup poll reveals that healthcare costs access to care and Ebola are the top three concerns of Americans. Gallup has measured public perceptions of the leading U.S. health problem annually since 1999. This year's results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey conducted in early November. At the time of the new survey only one of the four people who had been diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. was still being treated and the other two surviving patients had already been declared virus-free. Gallup researchers said that it is a testament to the gravity of the Ebola virus that it still sparks relatively high public concern several weeks after the peak of the U.S. scare.

Of that $1.2 billion will go overseas to help combat the epidemic in West Africa with support for programs such as labs infection control and waste management. The rest of the C.D.C. money will be used for domestic initiatives such as preparing states to respond to an Ebola case paying for quarantines that were put in place and worker training. Burwell was directed to provide a detailed spending plan 30 days after Congress' $1.1 trillion spending plan became law.

The hospital even bought underwear socks and booties in all sizes for the workers to wear because they also had to be disposed of after each two- to four-hour service time.

In the end Gold estimated it cost the hospital than $1 million to treat two Ebola patients at the Nebraska Medical Center. Those are the direct costs the Washington Post reported and doesn't include the cost of taking 10 beds out of service--a figure he estimates is close to $148 000. The hospital is still waiting for reimbursement but Gold urged Congress to approve funding to cover reimbursement for the cost of care that insurance doesn't provide.", "model the University of Kansas Hospital tried to replicate in a hurry when it got its first suspected Ebola patient turned up in early October. The Kansas City Kansas hospital emptied out a seven-bed patient care unit and quickly put up $10 000 worth of temporary walls and heavy plastic sheeting to create an isolation suite. It included sealed tunnels that caregivers could use to move between the patient\u2019s room and a decontamination area. The hospital even stockpiled shoes and undergarments for doctors and nurses who were told to dispose of every stitch as hazardous waste during decontamination. It took less than 48 hours to determine that the patient didn\u2019t have Ebola but since then even more light construction has been done to make it easier to ramp", "Effect on the Life and Health Insurance Industries The effects on the Life and Health insurance industries will clearly depend on whether the infected people are insured. Some of those who have died up to now were children and almost certainly did not have life insurance. Even if the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens or even hundreds of thousands of adults in Africa it is not likely to trigger many life insurance or health insurance claims there. Life insurance coverage in the three most affected countries\u00e2\u0080\u0094Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone\u00e2\u0080\u0094is extremely low. Indeed in Swiss Re\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent report on life premiums per capita (for 2013) the calculation for all three of these countries is so small that none makes the list. Even in the unlikely event that the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens of thousands of adults in the United States the financial impact will likely be quite manageable. This is because perhaps one-third of adults in the U.S. have life insurance only through their employment and the amount is typically equal to one year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income. Another one-third have individual life insurance with the average death benefit in the $200 000 range. In a typical year life insurers pay about 2 million death claims so another 100 000 would be only 5 percent more than typical. Moreover most life insurers are well capitalized and even the largest life insurers have reinsurance to prevent a surge in death claims from imperiling their solvency so that the net effect would likely be at most a reduction in the profit they would otherwise record. The cost of caring for Ebola cases would likely be at the high end of health insurance claims and the effect on health insurers would depend on the number of people suspected of being infected. Many people would need to be tested to see whether they have contracted the virus and the cost of isolation of those affected could be substantial. Note that some individuals may have no health insurance as was the case with the index (first) patient who died of Ebola at a Dallas hospital on October 8. In such cases treatment costs will likely be borne outside the private health insurance system.", "BB: I equate this to the old days of HIV when everyone lit their hair on fire until we recognized that precautions had to be universal and there is no concern.

While the vast majority of the public knows the basics of how the virus is transmitted \u2013 \u00c2 through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is sick with Ebola \u2013 fewer are aware that a person with Ebola must be showing symptoms in order to be contagious. Nearly two-thirds say they are at least somewhat worried the U.S. will see a large number of Ebola cases and about four in ten are worried that they or a family member will contract the disease.
