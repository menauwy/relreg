shipping personal effects,No worries; All you need to do is assess how much it would cost to bring your stuff down. Then compare it with purchasing the same from Qatar.,0.14545454545454545
shipping personal effects,I wish we'd brought more stuff with us when we came from NZ last year; don't have any advice re kids stuff but here's what I wish I'd known. *Bring cushion covers; knick-knacks; throws; and art; the furniture selection here is dismal but even worse is trying to find the little things. Depending on your taste you may be ok but if for example you like really simple contemporary things you're out of luck. We struggled to find things like a plain shower curtain; or a plain white dinner set. definitely bring cutlery! *Don't bring Duvet covers; the duvets here are sized differently and won't fit them. You probably won't need to bring sheets either (you'll end up with a king or super king bed) *Bring books (incl kids books) there are no good bookshops here *Bring a box of bits and pieces; things like craft knife; quick-unpick; tape; tapemeasure; vivids...etc you can buy all these things here but not necc at the same shop; I bought a box of random office stuff and I'm so glad i did! *If you br.....,0.08108108108108109
shipping personal effects,Yes - bring as much stuff as you can for the kids. Bring shoes for yourself - sandals - shoe shopping no that great here. Go to Briscoes for super king sheets and king size single sheets. One of the most important things to get; unless you actually enjoy sleeping on a concrete slab; is a mattress topper - like a foam/latex pad to go directly on top of your matresses. I suffered for a few months before managing to find one here but it took a bit of hassle and homework first. Bring one if you can so that you have it straight away. We didn't bring a vacuum cleaner and find we don't need one; the tiled floors get swept and mopped.Lots of my daughter's dvds don;t work here - wrong zone. Our tv worked here - bring yours if want to.,0.08187134502923978
shipping personal effects,My suggestion is that if you can fit toys in with your other effects without huge expense then anything you can bring that will keep them entertained here is a good thing - and will save you time and effort trying to duplicate it all after you arrive. Actually your children probably won't want to spend much time on their bikes and skateboards during the hot summer months here; and depending on where you will be living; it might be difficult to find somewhere in your neighbourhood for them to ride around safely too. By the way; while you're packing; I would be tucking a big jar of vegemite into a spare corner (if your kids like it) as it is very hard to find here and the few 150gm jars I have ever seen here cost a bomb! Hope this helps.,0.11764705882352942
shipping personal effects,If you have a generous shipping allowance; ship everything that matters to you and especially to your children. If you have special hobbies; ship any tools or items specific to that hobby - for example; quilters cannot buy batting in Qatar; or only rarely. Many children's toys are available very cheaply in Qatar; made in China; many break quickly or don't work properly. If you will live on a compound; a bike is a fun thing to have; but biking on the streets in Qatar is a hair-raising and life-threatening experience. Bring books. Bring anything that will make your life more homey and that will bring you comfort. Bring things you love but can leave behind or sell when leaving Qatar; knowing you can replace them back home. As Emma said; you can buy just about anything; but you may not like your choices. There is a lot of cheap - and ugly - stuff available; but quality is rare and may be priced two or three times higher than at home. On the other hand; there are European appliances which s.....,0.06666666666666668
shipping personal effects,It largely depends where you will live. If you are on a compound; many kids ride their bikes & skateboards inside the compounds. The electronic items; I would definitely bring because they will be much more expensive here. Good Luck with your move.,0.20289855072463767
shipping personal effects,we are constantly having to order and ship things over from NZ; the UK; the US as they are not available here. We end up paying way too much in shipping charges but you just cannot get the products here of the appropriate quality and any time you are looking for something specific you can never find it as the choice is extremely limited. Just recently it was toddler car seats and only today we have ordered a wooden playpen online from NZ to ship here as we cannot find a lightweight one in Qatar. We are constantly getting our family to buy and send us baby products from NZ which we cannot get here. So definitely bring whatever you can including medicines; homeopathic remedies if you use them (as they are not available at all here); skin care treatments etc. You can always sell old toys/things once the kids grow out of them or before you leave again - particularly if they are good quality items!,0.1134020618556701
shipping personal effects,I totally agree with EmmaS and Intlxpatr. I'm sooo glad we brought a huge stock of kids' books and toys - it was definitely worth it.,0.1509433962264151

Please help-Is this salary offer fair?,In my humble opinion; you should refuse this job offer flatly and with no regrets...

Please help-Is this salary offer fair?,"""angel6975; Here are answers to some of your questions: Q1: """"Btw; how much would a person from the west expect?"""" A: A WHOLE A LOT more than your offer; at LEAST double! I don't mean to sound racist; I'm only speaking of the reality of the workforce in the region; but don't waste your time comparing your offer to that of someone from the West. If you carry a Western country passport while you're originally from Singapore; then you should expect to be CLOSE (but not equal) to the offer someone from the west is going to get. Now; if you were carrying a Western country passport AND you are originally from the West (i.e. White or light-skinned) THEN you can expected to get the full advantageous treatment someone from the West gets. Again; I REALLY don't want to sound racist; but this is the reality of the market here. Q2: """"And what if it were a senior position?""""

Cruel conditions for visa ??,Yes; you need to talk to the Authorised person in the visa office to get a special permission. I did for my mother and without any hassel he signed my documents.,0.17543859649122806
Cruel conditions for visa ??,I read a post from deedee that all his parents and the in-laws above 70 years were able to visit Qatar. deedee it depends on your Nationality and I know yours. It will not be the same for someone from Asia. They should approach the concerend Officers to special approvl for it.,0.2278481012658228
Cruel conditions for visa ??,Well I don't believe it has anything to do with the health care issue. First of all HMC only treats for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be residents not visitors; if you don't have a health card you'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergencies. Second thought let us say it was really all about health care issues and not providing the emergency cases for free to sick elders who are none residents then simply the sponsor could be asked to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payments for a visiting relative; or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee; instead of simply not allowing the elderly -who should be treated with more respect honestly- to enter. After all what's the median age of the parents of working residents here? 40? I don't think so. But as some people say it's their roof; their country; let them do with it what ever they want.,0.10576923076923077
Cruel conditions for visa ??,The medical liability is an issue for them. However; you can get them to visit you. All you need is a special permission from the Captain at the immigration.,0.10909090909090909
Cruel conditions for visa ??,Because some nationalities are more likely to bring over elderly relatives to take advantage of the healthcare that is provided here. And those same nationalities are less likely to come and visit here and spend lots of money on accomodation; shopping etc. Unless you are contributing to the economy; either as a wage earner or a high spending tourist; you aren't really welcome here. And if your parents are that age; you should be visiting them; not vice versa.,0.09433962264150944

Working Visa issuance how long,If the company has available visa for your nationality; teh2008 is right you can get it in a day or two. But there are factors why your visa has not been released yet; e.g. the PRO is lazy; the PRO is on vacation; no visa approval yet; the position is on hold; other internal factors from your employer or agent etc. Better confirm again with your agent in the Phils. to remind the employer:),0.1764705882352941

how to Lose weight???,Hi; Honestly; there is no quick way. An unhealthy way is to take a diaretic; but you will lose only water; not fat. That is a temp. fix. As far as medication; there is only one which is called Orlistat. It inhibits the enzyme that breaks down fat; so this will allow fats to pass through you. Other than that; the other diet aids are false; or caffiene-based. In that case; drink coffee. The not eating rice at night is good advice. Remember; it is down to physics: when you eat about 7500 more calories than you burned; you gained a kg. the same is true for losing it.,0.10294117647058822

Make sure that you move in a brand new place since quality of accomodation is pretty lousy. Note that Doha is a pretty dull place and does not offer the expat life available in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.,0.3067484662576687

Worth it; if you buy a lot. Supposedly there's a catch my friends told me about AFTER I got back from Dubai (I'm currently looking for new friends;)). The weight price they quote is not just regular kg's; but kg in terms of volume. In essence they said you can expect to pay twice of what they've quoted you.

Usually one exit is more than enough for a normal employee and probably if he/she needs more travelling your sponsor can issue the exit when ever you needs it. And one important thing; if you are vanishing all of a sudden doing any illegal activities without the knowledge of the sponsor; he will be in trouble after you leave. So if you are contacting the sponsor each time for exit; he can ensure there is no complaints; bank loans; huge telephone bills; accident issues; over due in salary etc etc etc. Its highly adviceable for those who are into the field of business or frequent flyers... Its a matter of trust. And if you are flying atleast 30 times an year; you can say I need multiple exit. else its waste of money only. Hope the doubt is clear...,0.09326424870466321

where can I find acai berry in doha?,<strong> Hi there! My name is Dana; and I am from Bahrain. I read this post and followed the advice of jamesarl & bmw528 and ordered some acai berry to Doha over the internet. I just wanted to share my experience with you. I ordered 5 bottles of acai berry health supplement; and it took 6 days to arrive at my office. from: www.acaiberryboutique.com I took the supplements to my physician and doctor; she also uses the same supplement (acai berry pure) for her health. She had never ordered online; instead she used to buy them when she was in the US or have friends bring them over. She compared the stuff I got from the acai berry boutique (the online store) to the stuff she got in stores in the States; and she said the quality was MUCH better from the online store. We both read a lot of blogs and articles before buying online. There are lots of ways to check quality (color; taste; feel; texture; density etc) and my doctor said the online stuff was significantly better. She is also recommending it to her patients now for things like joint pain; inflammation; digestive system; and healthier body shape. I would also recommend you buy the product online; because it is higher quality than what you can get in stores here; and in most places in the States. They ship very quickly for a site located in America; and the prices are very good for such a supplement. Thank you jameearl and bmw528 for your recommendation. www.acaiberryboutique.com was an excellent place to buy acai berry! <strong>,0.03571428571428571

I have used them several times before for ordering to Doha; and would highly recommend them to all.... hope it works for you; enjoy! <strong><b>,0.12820512820512822
where can I find acai berry in doha?,I got my acai berry in 5 business days from this online site - acai berry boutique. I definitely recommend it to others wanting this supplement in Qatar. The stuff you get at supermarkets and GNC is junk here compared to this online site. Even take a look at the content; you will see its only less than 10%; but online site has PURE acai berry capsules; with 100% extract concentration. Results come much faster.

Once your family arrives at the arrival terminal; ask them to proceed to the Al Maha outlet BEFORE the immigration counter to their left.. Tell them to announce to the Al Maha representative about their names. They will be asked to wait in the spacious and comfortable lounge. An Al Maha rep will collect their passports and visas and clear their immigration for them and then come back to collect your family in 10 minutes. Your family will be lead through the immigration counter to the baggage pickup area counter where they can identify their luggages. They will direct someone to load the luggages onto a trolley and walk out near the public area where you can identify them Cheers,0.10810810810810811

Why is Islam discussed the most?,Thejam; well said lucid points; herein lies the confusion. Pitstop; why do you think it should be banned; how else can you explain the religon to many who want to know or debate; besides isn't that a muslims duty to not shy from discussions regarding his/her deen; but to address and explain and debate? Qatarexplorer; you also made valid points. Yes; some debaters obviously appear to pose as muslims yet clearly are pregiduce. Don't you think that perhaps the debaters you mentioned don't actually hate Islam? People often attack and fear what they don't understand; its humans psychology. I'd like to believe that a great majority; regardless of their negative comments; are actually drawn to Islam because there is something undoubtedly real and logical about this religon and they may actually be searching or yearning for answers. I only wish that some muslims would debate responsibly knowing that they are at that very moment representing Islam in these peoples eyes and therefore bear the responsibility of tolerance; patients & respect when we are faced with not so civilised debates because ALdeen al akhlaq ( religon is manners) This reminds me of when the prophet Mohammed pbuh was driven out of Altayef with stones thrown at him because they refused his message; then God sent him the Angels (of Wind and Mountains) and asked do you want vengence? To this the Prophet pbuh replied (I cant quote accurately but the general jist of the response was) 'They know not and perhaps one day good will come from this people',0.1568627450980392

White Supremacists in Washington State,"The family of a man who admitted he planted a bomb at Spokane's Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade is asking a federal judge to issue a lenient sentence. Family members of Kevin W. Harpham 37 described him in letters to the judge as a gentle intelligent well-liked young man whose actions puzzled them. ""I know how and what he is "" Harpham's mother Lana Harpham wrote to U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush. ""I am very proud to say he is my son. I would want no other."" The letters are part of a package presented to the court by Harpham's defense attorneys in advance of his Nov. 30 sentencing. He faces 27 to 32 years in federal prison. Prosecutors will file their sentencing recommendation soon Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Rice said. He had no comment on the defense request for 27 years. Harpham pleaded guilty in September to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to injure people in a hate crime. Two other charges will be dismissed. Harpham was arrested in March 9 after federal investigators tracked evidence including the purchase of lead fishing weights that were laced with rat poison and packed into the bomb as shrapnel. The bomb was discovered along the parade route Jan. 17 and disarmed without exploding. There were no injuries. Harpham's attorneys wrote that a sentence of 27 years was sufficient. ""Mr. Harpham who has lived an exemplary life until recent events who has no criminal history who has been a good son brother neighbor soldier and friend deserves to have this Court take into account the good works that account for the majority of his life "" defense attorneys wrote. ""I have never seen Kevin be anything but gentle with both people and animals "" wrote his sister Carmen Harpham. The letters describe family members attempting to understand how the man they knew would leave a bomb in downtown Spokane. ""There are many things that I have heard over the past nine months regarding my brother's actions that I cannot explain "" Carmen Harpham wrote. ""While I know we do not share a common philosophy about race I am puzzled at what brought my brother to this point in his life.""",0.025641025641025644
White Supremacists in Washington State,Noah Lerner doesn't remember hearing much about the civil rights movement when he was in public school. Now a senior at a small liberal arts college in rural Washington state Lerner aims to ensure some students learn more about a key moment in America's history. Whitman College is partnering with the Southern Poverty Law Center a nonprofit civil rights organization based in Montgomery Ala. to help its students teach schoolchildren about the civil rights movement in Walla Walla Wash. The small city known more for its sweet onions and wine in the state's southeast corner might seem an unlikely place to engage students in the topic of racial justice: Blacks make up less than 3 percent of the population and even less at the college and Washington state sits many miles from the movement's heated center in the Deep South. But the inland Pacific Northwest has long garnered attention for white supremacist activity â just last year police rerouted a Martin Luther King Jr. parade in Spokane after a bomb was found along the original route â and the rapidly growing Latino population has raised its own concerns about civil rights.,0.07766990291262135
White Supremacists in Washington State,The announcement Friday afternoon came amid news reports noting that the fire coincided with the 27th anniversary of another more well-known standoff - one that killed white supremacist Robert J. Mathews the founder of the neo-Nazi group The Order on Whidbey Island Wash. as his house burned down around him. Stanbary had a history of espousing white supremacist views according to the Southern Poverty Law Center which tracks hate groups. But investigators said Friday they did not believe the fire at his house had anything to do with the anniversary. Washougal detectives arranged with Stanbary's lawyer Tuesday that he would turn himself in on Thursday they said. Stanbary was arrested and served 90 days in jail following a standoff with sheriff's deputies in Bonner County Idaho in 1994. Authorities seized a weapons cache at his home including a grenade launcher a sawed-off shotgun and six AK-47 assault rifles. Homer Adams who worked for Stanbary at a landscaping company told the AP his boss mentioned Randy Weaver a white separatist involved in a deadly confrontation with federal agents in Idaho in 1992. Adams said the homeowner also seemed angry about the 1993 federal action in Waco Texas that led to the deaths of dozens of members of the Branch Davidian Church.,0.07017543859649122

healthcare impacts of ebola,The arrival of Ebola in the United States this year led to an unprecedented medical response involving experimental drugs round-the-clock care and layers upon layers of protective gear. And none of it has been cheap. Nine people have been treated for the virus in the U.S. since August. Seven recovered. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center which treated one of them estimates treatment for patients diagnosed with Ebola costs $50 000 a day. Officials at the University of Nebraska Medical Center which cared for two patients put the daily cost at $30 000 and the total at $1.16 million for a single patient. Most patients have been hospitalized for more than two weeks. The U.S. has shown it can beat Ebola. But who will pay for the expensive care it takes to do it? It's a tough question and one that the people holding the bills seem reluctant to answer. Hospitals that have treated patients in Georgia Nebraska New York and Texas did not respond to requests for comment nor did the governors' offices of these states. NIH was forthcoming about cost of care but the feds pick up the tab for treatment there. The topic of payment came up during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this month but only briefly. The Obama administration had requested $6.18 billion in emergency funding for Ebola response efforts in the U.S. Missing from the request said Sen. Mike Johanns was funding that would cover treatment of patients with Ebola on American soil. The federal government should cover the University of Nebraska Medical Center's costs he said because it had asked the medical facility to take in patients. We were glad to do it said the Republican lawmaker from Nebraska. But it seems at this point some assistance in terms of reimbursement would be appropriate because treating an Ebola patient is worlds different than treating Mike Johanns who walks in with a severe case of the flu. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that conversations about payment have so far remained between hospitals and private insurers. To date it has not been an issue that has come to us she said. If this is something that [Congress] wants to discuss as part of this funding we're happy to entertain that. Sen. Barbara Mikulski D-Md. the Senate Appropriations Committee chair agreed with Johanns about exploring federal reimbursement options. It is costly she said at the hearing referring to Ebola treatments. But neither the committee nor the panelists had a real solution. Let's talk about this. Let's keep working on it. Some hospitals faced with these costs are tentatively looking to the feds to foot the bill. New York City health officials said earlier this month that Bellevue Hospital's treatment of one patient with Ebola was expected to be so expensive that they would seek federal funding to help pay the bills. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta which treated four patients has asked Congress to approve funding for full reimbursement for Ebola cases. One case they said can cost up to $1 million. Caring for patients with Ebola virus disease effectively and safely is enormously resource-consuming far above and beyond usual care the hospital wrote in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Nov. 7. Emory officials said payment should be a collaborative effort using both federal and private sources. At the time of this writing there are no reported cases of Ebola in the U.S. But federal health officials have said that as long as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa—which has infected more than 15 300 people and killed 5 459 of them—rages on there could be more patients. And those patients most likely won't be able to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills on their own. More from,0.01812688821752266
healthcare impacts of ebola,That's the model the University of Kansas Hospital tried to replicate in a hurry when it got its first suspected Ebola patient turned up in early October. The Kansas City Kansas hospital emptied out a seven-bed patient care unit and quickly put up $10 000 worth of temporary walls and heavy plastic sheeting to create an isolation suite. It included sealed tunnels that caregivers could use to move between the patient's room and a decontamination area. The hospital even stockpiled shoes and undergarments for doctors and nurses who were told to dispose of every stitch as hazardous waste during decontamination. It took less than 48 hours to determine that the patient didn't have Ebola but since then even more light construction has been done to make it easier to ramp up in the future.,0.06802721088435375
healthcare impacts of ebola,new Gallup poll reveals that healthcare costs access to care and Ebola are the top three concerns of Americans. Gallup has measured public perceptions of the leading U.S. health problem annually since 1999. This year's results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey conducted in early November. At the time of the new survey only one of the four people who had been diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. was still being treated and the other two surviving patients had already been declared virus-free. Gallup researchers said that it is a testament to the gravity of the Ebola virus that it still sparks relatively high public concern several weeks after the peak of the U.S. scare.

healthcare impacts of ebola,Sylvia Mathews Burwell the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services issued a spending plan on Thursday for the nearly $2.8 billion in Ebola funding allocated by Congress though the plan is too short on detail to know if New York will receive the money advocates have called for. The majority of the money—$1.77 billion—will go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of that $1.2 billion will go overseas to help combat the epidemic in West Africa with support for programs such as labs infection control and waste management. The rest of the C.D.C. money will be used for domestic initiatives such as preparing states to respond to an Ebola case paying for quarantines that were put in place and worker training. Burwell was directed to provide a detailed spending plan 30 days after Congress' $1.1 trillion spending plan became law. That deadline is today but Burwell's proposal provides only top-line numbers.,0.05681818181818182

healthcare impacts of ebola,Start with a $100 000 order for more personal protective equipment than usual and the price quickly mounted when the University of Kansas Hospital last week cared for a possible Ebola patient. Add about $8 000 to $10 000 worth of heavy plastic sheeting and materials used to seal off the isolation area from the rest of the hospital. Count in nursing overtime. Tally extra costs for hazardous waste removal. Figure in communication costs to handle the media. And note that an entire seven-bed intensive care unit â which usually would have been filled with other patients â was devoted to the care of just one person. âThere were major categories of costs and expenses above and beyond what weâd necessarily have for any other patient â said Chris Ruder vice president of patient care services at the hospital. The Kansas City Kan. Ebola scare which turned out to be more of an infectious disease practice event gave the hospital a clear window into the cost of best-practice care for the infectious and often fatal disease. By using equipment and procedures that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since said are the right things to do KU Hospital had an expensive 48-hour experience. The full bill isnât known but a recap of those stressful days hints at what any medical center might face if a possible Ebola sufferer comes to its doors. âFor example everything the physicians and nurses wore when they went into the patientâs room was completely disposable â Ruder said. âAnd we had six nurses at any one time taking care of that one patient â a twelvefold increase in nursing care instead of the usual one nurse taking care of two patients in the ICU â plus physicians and a dedicated infectious disease team. The ratio of human resource to one patient was exorbitantly higher.â The expensive airtight protective suits hoods gloves and respirators could only be worn for two to four hours at a stretch before the workers became drenched in sweat. The hospital even bought underwear socks and booties in all sizes for the workers to wear because they also had to be disposed of after each two- to four-hour service time. Separately the International Association of Fire Fighters calculated an average cost of $382.31 for one set of personal protective equipment that would be considered adequate for a first responder to handle a possible Ebola victim. The association points out that the protective suitâs cost doesnât begin to consider extra costs for throwing away a gurney mattress blankets or anything else that may carry the virus after a sufferer is transported in an ambulance. Nor does it figure the expense of disinfecting care providers equipment or vehicles. Ruder noted that major hospitals already prepared to handle infectious disease have many materials and facilities such as negative-airflow rooms already on hand. But the emergency construction of separate caregiving zones outside the patientâs isolation room required a temporary sealed tunnel of plastic sheeting and creation of anterooms for workers to put on and take off protective gear and move to the shower. âWeâve even replaced the ceiling tiles in our negative-airflow rooms with nonporous tiles â Ruder said.,0.025408348457350273

Richard Drew/AP Share this on Facebook Tweet this on Twitter Share this on Google Plus Share this on LinkedIn Print this article Email this article Increase size The arrival of Ebola in the United States this year led to an unprecedented medical response involving experimental drugs round-the-clock care and layers upon layers of protective gear. And none of it has been cheap. Nine people have been treated for the virus in the U.S. since August. Seven recovered. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center which treated one of them estimates treatment for patients diagnosed with Ebola costs $50 000 a day. Officials at the University of Nebraska Medical Center which cared for two patients put the daily cost at $30 000 and the total at $1.16 million for a single patient. Most patients have been hospitalized for more than two weeks. The U.S. has shown it can beat Ebola. But who will pay for the expensive care it takes to do it? It's a tough question and one that the people holding the bills seem reluctant to answer. Hospitals that have treated patients in Georgia Nebraska New York and Texas did not respond to requests for comment nor did the governors' offices of these states. NIH was forthcoming about cost of care but the feds pick up the tab for treatment there. The topic of payment came up during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this month but only briefly. The Obama administration had requested $6.18 billion in emergency funding for Ebola response efforts in the U.S. Missing from the request said Sen. Mike Johanns was funding that would cover treatment of patients with Ebola on American soil. The federal government should cover the University of Nebraska Medical Center's costs he said because it had asked the medical facility to take in patients. ""We were glad to do it "" said the Republican lawmaker from Nebraska. ""But it seems at this point some assistance in terms of reimbursement would be appropriate because treating an Ebola patient is worlds different than treating Mike Johanns who walks in with a severe case of the flu."" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that conversations about payment have so far remained between hospitals and private insurers. ""To date it has not been an issue that has come to us "" she said. ""If this is something that [Congress] wants to discuss as part of this funding we're happy to entertain that."" Sen. Barbara Mikulski D-Md. the Senate Appropriations Committee chair agreed with Johanns about exploring federal reimbursement options. ""It is costly "" she said at the hearing referring to Ebola treatments. But neither the committee nor the panelists had a real solution. ""Let's talk about this. Let's keep working on it."" Some hospitals faced with these costs are tentatively looking to the feds to foot the bill. New York City health officials said earlier this month that Bellevue Hospital's treatment of one patient with Ebola was expected to be so expensive that they would seek federal funding to help pay the bills. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta which treated four patients has asked Congress to approve funding for full reimbursement for Ebola cases. One case they said can cost up to $1 million. ""Caring for patients with Ebola virus disease effectively and safely is enormously resource-consuming far above and beyond usual care "" the hospital wrote in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Nov. 7.

healthcare impacts of ebola,no one predicted the cost of the prep as well as treatment of patients with the virus. The cost of treating Ebola patients at Nebraska Medical Center's biocontainment unit averaged $30 000 a day according to Jeffrey Gold M.D. chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center who testified Tuesday during a House Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing. In the end Gold estimated it cost the hospital than $1 million to treat two Ebola patients at the Nebraska Medical Center. Those are the direct costs the Washington Post reported and doesn't include the cost of taking 10 beds out of service--a figure he estimates is close to $148 000. The hospital is still waiting for reimbursement but Gold urged Congress to approve funding to cover reimbursement for the cost of care that insurance doesn't provide.,0.06578947368421052
healthcare impacts of ebola,model the University of Kansas Hospital tried to replicate in a hurry when it got its first suspected Ebola patient turned up in early October. The Kansas City Kansas hospital emptied out a seven-bed patient care unit and quickly put up $10 000 worth of temporary walls and heavy plastic sheeting to create an isolation suite. It included sealed tunnels that caregivers could use to move between the patient’s room and a decontamination area. The hospital even stockpiled shoes and undergarments for doctors and nurses who were told to dispose of every stitch as hazardous waste during decontamination. It took less than 48 hours to determine that the patient didn’t have Ebola but since then even more light construction has been done to make it easier to ramp,0.07142857142857144
healthcare impacts of ebola,Effect on the Life and Health Insurance Industries The effects on the Life and Health insurance industries will clearly depend on whether the infected people are insured. Some of those who have died up to now were children and almost certainly did not have life insurance. Even if the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens or even hundreds of thousands of adults in Africa it is not likely to trigger many life insurance or health insurance claims there. Life insurance coverage in the three most affected countriesâGuinea Liberia and Sierra Leoneâis extremely low. Indeed in Swiss Reâs most recent report on life premiums per capita (for 2013) the calculation for all three of these countries is so small that none makes the list. Even in the unlikely event that the Ebola virus spreads to infect tens of thousands of adults in the United States the financial impact will likely be quite manageable. This is because perhaps one-third of adults in the U.S. have life insurance only through their employment and the amount is typically equal to one yearâs income. Another one-third have individual life insurance with the average death benefit in the $200 000 range. In a typical year life insurers pay about 2 million death claims so another 100 000 would be only 5 percent more than typical. Moreover most life insurers are well capitalized and even the largest life insurers have reinsurance to prevent a surge in death claims from imperiling their solvency so that the net effect would likely be at most a reduction in the profit they would otherwise record. The cost of caring for Ebola cases would likely be at the high end of health insurance claims and the effect on health insurers would depend on the number of people suspected of being infected. Many people would need to be tested to see whether they have contracted the virus and the cost of isolation of those affected could be substantial. Note that some individuals may have no health insurance as was the case with the index (first) patient who died of Ebola at a Dallas hospital on October 8. In such cases treatment costs will likely be borne outside the private health insurance system.,0.031168831168831165
healthcare impacts of ebola,BB: I equate this to the old days of HIV when everyone lit their hair on fire until we recognized that precautions had to be universal and there is no concern.

healthcare impacts of ebola,Start with a $100 000 order for more personal protective equipment than usual and the price quickly mounted when the University of Kansas Hospital last week cared for a possible Ebola patient. Add about $8 000 to $10 000 worth of heavy plastic sheeting and materials used to seal off the isolation area from the rest of the hospital. Count in nursing overtime. Tally extra costs for hazardous waste removal. Figure in communication costs to handle the media. And note that an entire seven-bed intensive care unit — which usually would have been filled with other patients — was devoted to the care of just one person.“There were major categories of costs and expenses above and beyond what we’d necessarily have for any other patient ” said Chris Ruder vice president of patient care services at the hospital. The Kansas City Kan. Ebola scare which turned out to be more of an infectious disease practice event gave the hospital a clear window into the cost of best-practice care for the infectious and often fatal disease. By using equipment and procedures that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since said are the right things to do KU Hospital had an expensive 48-hour experience. The full bill isn’t known but a recap of those stressful days hints at what any medical center might face if a possible Ebola sufferer comes to its doors.“For example everything the physicians and nurses wore when they went into the patient’s room was completely disposable ” Ruder said. “And we had six nurses at any one time taking care of that one patient — a twelvefold increase in nursing care instead of the usual one nurse taking care of two patients in the ICU — plus physicians and a dedicated infectious disease team. The ratio of human resource to one patient was exorbitantly higher.”The expensive airtight protective suits hoods gloves and respirators could only be worn for two to four hours at a stretch before the workers became drenched in sweat. The hospital even bought underwear socks and booties in all sizes for the workers to wear because they also had to be disposed of after each two- to four-hour service time. Separately the International Association of Fire Fighters calculated an average cost of $382.31 for one set of personal protective equipment that would be considered adequate for a first responder to handle a possible Ebola victim. The association points out that the protective suit’s cost doesn’t begin to consider extra costs for throwing away a gurney mattress blankets or anything else that may carry the virus after a sufferer is transported in an ambulance. Nor does it figure the expense of disinfecting care providers equipment or vehicles. Ruder noted that major hospitals already prepared to handle infectious disease have many materials and facilities such as negative-airflow rooms already on hand. But the emergency construction of separate caregiving zones outside the patient’s isolation room required a temporary sealed tunnel of plastic sheeting and creation of anterooms for workers to put on and take off protective gear and move to the shower.“We’ve even replaced the ceiling tiles in our negative-airflow rooms with nonporous,0.025547445255474453
healthcare impacts of ebola,Kaiser Health Policy News Index: Special Focus On Ebola Oct 16 2014 | Liz Hamel Jamie Firth and Mollyann Brodie With the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and individual cases in the U.S. and Europe making international headlines the latest Kaiser Health Policy News Index examines Americansâ attention to the Ebola crisis awareness of key facts about the disease and views of the U.S. role in addressing Ebola in Africa and at home. Fielded October 8-14 during which time a nurse in Dallas became the second patient diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.1 the survey finds that Ebola tops the list of news stories followed by the public this month with U.S. airstrikes against Islamic militants the only other story garnering similar levels of attention. While the vast majority of the public knows the basics of how the virus is transmitted – Â through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is sick with Ebola – fewer are aware that a person with Ebola must be showing symptoms in order to be contagious. Nearly two-thirds say they are at least somewhat worried the U.S. will see a large number of Ebola cases and about four in ten are worried that they or a family member will contract the disease. Still a majority believes the most likely scenario is that Ebola will be contained to a small number of cases in the U.S. and most trust their local state and federal health authorities to prevent Ebolaâs spread. Most Americans â including majorities of Republicans Democrats and Independents â think the U.S. should play a major role in addressing the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Majorities support the U.S. providing financial aid medical supplies and personnel and fewer but still a majority support sending troops and military personnel to fight Ebola in Africa with the publicâs top two reasons for providing such support being to protect the health of Americans and to save lives in the African countries affected. The public is divided about whether the U.S. government is doing enough to fight Ebola abroad and at home. Attention To News News coverage of Ebola in Africa and the U.S. topped the list of closely-followed news stories this month. Seven in ten (69 percent) say they followed news about the diagnosis of the first Ebola case in the U.S. âveryâ or âfairlyâ closely and nearly as many report closely following the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (63 percent similar to 62 percent last month). Close attention is somewhat heightened on the home front with a larger share saying they followed the first U.S. Ebola case âveryâ closely (32 percent) compared with the outbreak in West Africa (24 percent).,0.021367521367521368

healthcare impacts of ebola,poll reveals that healthcare costs access to care and Ebola are the top three concerns of Americans. Gallup has measured public perceptions of the leading U.S. health problem annually since 1999. This year's results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey conducted in early November. At the time of the new survey only one of the four people who had been diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. was still being treated and the other two surviving patients had already been declared virus-free. Gallup researchers said that it is a testament to the gravity of the Ebola virus that it still sparks relatively high public concern several weeks after the peak of the U.S. scare.,0.0916030534351145
