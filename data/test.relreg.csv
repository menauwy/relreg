how old baby can travel Qatar airways?,So to answer the question; i'm not certain if you are inquiring about Airlines policy or government visa policy.... If its the former; best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter; then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha); she didn't travel till she was 6 months old; but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it.

Guitar / Music Shops in Doha,Hi QatarKiwi; Welcome to Doha. Hope you are settling in. As far as quality acoustic guitars here in Doha; there is basically nothing to speak of. Modern home has a very basic Yamaha (although I had heard they were going to expand); but the Souq selection is woeful. Al Badie is quite good for gear and amps; some string; but nothing really for acoustic. (Phone number is 442-3554; give them a call if you like) If you are going to Dubai; check out Zak's Electronics near the Post Office in Karama or some of the shop at Fish Roundabout (taxi's will know these places) Strings are cheaper there than here in Doha and much more selection. Zak's is primarily electric (Fender; Ibanez so on) but they have some nice Fender; Yamaha and Guild acoustic guitars too. I haven't found Takamine anywhere out here; but depending on the airline; most will take a guitar as extra for minor fee.

When you get to the little roundabout in front of the resort go straight over; and head 45 degrees to the right and you will find it - then just head south. There are ALWAYS Qataris flying around who seem to take great pleasure in pulling incompetant foriegners out of the sand when they get stuck... its usually quicker to wait for a Qatari than it is to dig yourself out. remember the basic rules 1) Do not stop on flat ground esp at the base of a dune as the sand is very soft there. Stop on a slope so gravity can help you get going. 2) If you see somebody else who is stuck; dont park next to them - follow point 1 above; otherwise there will be 2 cars for the Qatari guys to pull out. 3) Dont slow down as you approach a dune - you need momentum. 4) Keep momentum at a.....,0.22372881355932203

Just Gym,Thomas; Some of the newer apartment compounds have gyms in them. I've seen a very nice gym setup in a compound off of Salwa. I haven't been to Gold's Gym on D-Ring; but I understand that you can get 10 single day passes for 370 riyals (roughly $10 US per visit). I'm not sure what the full membership fee is; but $10 per trip sounds high when gym memberships in the states could be obtained for as little as $35 per month. Yearly memberships can be bought for access to hotel facilities; but these may be fairly pricy too. If money is no object then looking at hotel memberships is probably where you'll find the nicest facilities. Some hotels may offer day passes so that you can check things out and compare. European Family Club (Garvey's) has gym facilities; but I haven't made use of them as of yet (Individual memberships are about 800 riyals annually and family 1200 I think).

Procedures for buying are http://www.propertyfrontiers.com/research/country-guides/africa-and-the-middle-east/qatar/buyers-guide.aspx 1. Reserve the property Once you have chosen your ideal property; a reservation agreement is to be signed with the seller and a reservation deposit needs to be paid (will form part of the purchase price). 2.

Exchange Contract Before singing preliminary purchase contract; buyers are suggested to consult a local law firm or conveyancing lawyer on analyse the risk; any unfavourable terms of the contract. Upon signing of the contract; first instalment/payment is often required. 5. Ownership Certificate Once the property is completed; the following procedures need to be completed in order for the seller to transfer the final title to the buyer: a. Bring the title of the property to the archive office of the real estate registry b. Fill sale-purchase agreement that is available in the real estate registry c. The archive office registers the title information in the Archive database d. The seller takes the file from the archive office to the registrar office in the real estate registry e. The registrar office checks non-encumbrances f. The buyer pays the transfer fee at the real estate registry g. The notary office checks whether the seller is the owner before allowing the transfer to take place h. The director of the real estate registry office approves the transfer agreement i.

how to extend the visit visa after 6 months and how long period?,I would suggest not to bring your family unless u get ur RP done. Because 1s their tourist visa is expired and you don;t have family visa they won't be able to come back to Doha for next 3 months (explained by the Visa incharge in the company of my husband ). And your RP would take approx. 7 months as they need your salary statement for 6 months which you'll get only when you have a bank account. After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank; you need Rent agreement; your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also); you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago. Might have changed now) unless you get your family visa and their RPs & QIDs. Working out for their RPs & QIDs will be much easier than yours. All the Best.,0.08571428571428572

Procedure of direct hire from Phils to Qatar,i was direct hired also; the thing i remember is that i have my offer letter and stamped visa from qatar embassy in manila (processed thru dhl together with my police and nbi clearance and medical certificate) and my flight schedule. Processed my OEC in POEA 2nd floor and it took me about 2weeks since they require a letter from the company stating that they are in-charge in sending our corpse if we die here in doha (foolish thing). but if you want your relative to come too soon without any hassels in Ninoy A. airport give him a Singapore Tour Package and then from there another ticket to Doha. He can print his Doha workvisa and keep it with him that he may present it in NDIA immigration here which is hassel free.,0.24875621890547261
Procedure of direct hire from Phils to Qatar,Kabayan; there are no more direct hire employees coming from the Philippines. There should be a job order filed by the employer through the Embassy here. This job order is to be given to an accredited recruitment agency. This is to assure and guarantee the safety of the employee to be hired. In short; there will be placement fees; pre-employment medical; PDOS; visa processing; etc. Cumbersome; time consuming but safe. The above comments pertains to getting here via a visiting visa or business visa. This is an option but personally; not advisable. You choice. Good Luck.,0.28220858895705525
Procedure of direct hire from Phils to Qatar,Hi; Being a direct hire from the Philippines entails a lot of head ache considering the red tape in Manila if could be very frustrating until the very end. With so many requirements to prepare and a lot more; chances are you will not be able to come to Qatar in just 30 days (if you are lucky enough). I am a Recruitment Officer in Doha and I bring people from Manila via the Bangkok route; meaning you book yourself as tourist to Bangkok (round trip ticket; a night stay in a hotel) and the following day you can board a plane to Doha. Honestly; we get nothing from the government not even a good service. SMS me and I will tell you this way; when you arrive in Doha; just register at the Polo Office.,0.21782178217821782

If you're interested; send me message and I can give you the no. of an agent who is processing for deployment; meaning work visa will be processed thru POEA legally. He processed for my sister's work visa. Anyhow; you can try other means if you want to take the risk.,0.2248520710059172

Strain of bird flu in Riyadh,Symptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenza-like symptoms (e.g.; fever; cough; sore throat; and muscle aches) to eye infections; pneumonia; severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress); and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of avian influenza may depend on which virus caused the infection. In general; H5N1 remains a very rare disease in people. The H5N1 virus does not infect humans easily; and if a person is infected; it is very difficult for the virus to spread to another person. While there has been some human-to-human spread of H5N1; it has been limited; inefficient and unsustained.,0.11764705882352942

I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay.

Sharing an apartment with someone else may save you around 1;000-1;500 QAR per month. 2- Renting a small car (1500 cc) is around 1;500-1;700 QAR per month. 3- Food costs for a single per month are around 800-1;500 QAR depending on what you eat and drink. The previous number increments if you drink alcohol. 4- Going out on weekends costs around 200-300 QAR depending on what you do (that's about 800-900 QAR per month). 5- Water and electricity bills are around 300 QAR per month. Any extra services like mobile and internet are at about 250 QAR each (that's another 500 QAR per month). Need I continue...?!

Why al khebra driving school force for pre test;lack of qualified instructor or another way of profitability?,So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule.

Why al khebra driving school force for pre test;lack of qualified instructor or another way of profitability?,I also have driving licence(from home country) and go for short course but after having pre-test (which is not mandatory)they forced for full course and according to other student it is their practice especially for short course student and important is they never tells students about such so called pre-test at the time of admission after having few classes they inform you about pre-test which is unfair........ while with karawa after completed the classes you can go directly for test with police department(which is quite normal).,0.37241379310344824

half-sisters,without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company?

Attawapiskat First Nation Housing Crisis,"Around the corner from the bright blue band office, Lisa Kiokee-Linklater lives in a tented shack that has a folded tarp as a doorway. She is watching television with her two toddlers. Two mattresses lie on the floor, and each mattress is a bed for three. Mould is climbing in jagged patterns from the floor onto the childrenâs bed, even though Kiokee-Linklater just bought it last summer. The mattress cost her $1,000. There is no running water, no bathroom and cold comes through the uninsulated floor. While many residents in makeshift homes like hers have a bucket stashed in a corner for a latrine, Linklater relies on diapers for her youngest children, and her in-lawsâ house next door for herself. There is little room for her four children to play. The broiling cast-iron wood stove that takes up one corner of the room represents a burn hazard and eliminates the notion of the rambunctious play that is the norm for most young kids. Moving into the tent was Kiokee-Linklaterâs choice. It seemed a step up from her previous home next door, where she shared a single bathroom with 20 other people until it became too much for her and her growing family. âItâs kind of better, yeah,â she said, keeping a watchful eye on a son as he ate spaghetti with his fingers. âBut during the winter, itâs cold.

Attawapiskat First Nation Housing Crisis,"Around the corner from the bright blue band office Lisa Kiokee-Linklater lives in a tented shack that has a folded tarp as a doorway. She is watching television with her two toddlers. Two mattresses lie on the floor and each mattress is a bed for three. Mould is climbing in jagged patterns from the floor onto the children's bed even though Kiokee-Linklater just bought it last summer. The mattress cost her $1 000. There is no running water no bathroom and cold comes through the uninsulated floor. While many residents in makeshift homes like hers have a bucket stashed in a corner for a latrine Linklater relies on diapers for her youngest children and her in-laws' house next door for herself. There is little room for her four children to play. The broiling cast-iron wood stove that takes up one corner of the room represents a burn hazard and eliminates the notion of the rambunctious play that is the norm for most young kids. Moving into the tent was Kiokee-Linklater's choice. It seemed a step up from her previous home next door where she shared a single bathroom with 20 other people until it became too much for her and her growing family.

Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new landcruiser?,it will make a difference if you will change your header; and full exhaust system. it's a landcruiser; why set it up? plus you might get rip off; k&n filters goes for around Qr250.I'm not into 4wd. if you want to set up a car; go for honda or 350Z!!!,0.17699115044247785
Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new landcruiser?,Bro; I agree with cdpascual initial performance gainer would be Intake/Header/Exhaust modifications. If you modifed the Intake plate filter (K&N) then you have to modify your header (use S/S Mandrel bend headers) and an aftermarket exhaust chambered/free-flow muffler ( ex.Tanabe G-Medallion) plus a layer of thermal wrap to ever notice performance. If you can afford a Cold Air Intake that would be better; with all this modifications this would surely void your warranty. Cheers;,0.1285714285714286

Companies holding passports of expatriates,hummm; seems I was right after all!!! ;p very illegal now!!! Get it; and keep it.

The problem is; people do not know their rights here; and get scared from their employer. If in doubt go to Jarir bookstore; or google the labor dept website. You can buy the labor law book here in Qatar and read it. If they insist on you giving it back to them; make up any reason you still need it; after a while they should forget about it; it is your passport!! don't give it back go report them to the dept. of labour; if they keep insisting; the labour dept will have heavy fines for each passport the company is holding!!!

Doing MBA in Qatar,I would place my money on Qatar University; cos the last time I found out about that; it sounded pretty good; the subjects were nice enough; and their teaching I have heard is decent enough; Having said all this; people need to understand a quick thing that; in a place of this sort where the Education System is still picking up; the best solution is either to head for Qatar University cos the job placements I heard is quite nice after completing the MBA course...or wait till one of those American Univs; offer an MBA Programme...as simple as that... Not too much value in Distant or OFf campus learnign crap...,0.3235294117647059
Doing MBA in Qatar,I have been doing research on this MBA thing in Doha for the last one year or more but so far I have found nothing worthwhile. The only options available were at Qatar university but I am not sure about its credentials and the second option was National education center somewhere near Lulu. They offer MBA evening classes couple of times a week and the degree we get is from Allagappa university of Madras. The third option is Doha Training Center; they had an ad in the papers a few weeks ago. They too are offering MBA thu some American university or atleast that is what they claimed but when I went there to check it out; it turned out to be some American university based in the Phillipines. Even the degree that we would get after completing it would say Phillipines on it. So I decided that it is better to do some distance MBA from my own country Pakistan than to go for that.. If any of you find out some good and recognized MBA degree being offered in Qatar; please let me know. Thanks,0.2939068100358423

Qatar Airways vs Emirates,Yeh I flew Joberg from Dubai like 2 years ago when we were starting there and i was upgraded to Businesss Class. But i can really tell you that QR Economy class service on these long haul flights was better than the EK J class service.

This is more rampant in Egypt than Turkey. Then again; Egypt is a cheaper location overall. 4. Which one is easier for visa on arrival for Indians? I don't have an answer for this one.

My limited knowledge of these devices indicates to me that your work would be quite repetitiouis and mundane; requiring long hours. QR10k seems a little low to live in Qatar where basic foodstuffs are expensive and of poor quality. Personally; if I couldn't be happy with my renumeration knowing I was on a good deal; I'd go home.

Airborne Transmission,"A few animal studies have suggested the possibility of Ebola transmission via aerosols, the authors found. One study involved Ebola-inoculated rhesus monkeys and control monkeys that were housed in the same room but separated by about 3 meters. Two of the three control monkeys developed Ebola virus disease (EVD) 10 and 11 days after the death of the infected monkeys. The researchers suggested that the controls had been infected through aerosol, oral, or conjunctival exposure to virus-laden droplets, and said studies of lung tissue suggested aerosol infection. In another study, six infected piglets were placed near four caged macaques, with a wire barrier that kept the piglets at least 20 centimeters from the cages. All the macaques were infected. The researchers concluded that transmission could have been due to inhalation of aerosols, but other routes were also possible, such as droplets landing on objects in the cages. In a third study, however, two uninfected monkeys did not contract Ebola after being placed next to two infected monkeys in open-barred cages for several days. ",0.02185792349726776

Airborne Transmission,potential for transmission via inhalation of aerosols therefore cannot be ruled out by the observed risk factors or our knowledge of the infection process.

Cough was identified among some cases in a 1995 outbreak in Kikwit Democratic Republic of theCongo 11 and coughs are known to emit viruses in respirable particles.17 The act of vomiting produces anaerosol and has been implicated in airborne transmission of gastrointestinal viruses.18 19 Regarding diarrhea even when contained by toilets toilet flushing emits a pathogen-laden aerosol that disperses,0.05084745762711865

Airborne Transmission,"Another NHP to NHP (monkey to monkey) study was published in July of this year. Rhesus monkeys were infected with Ebola via intramuscular injection and they were terminated on day 6 after becoming unresponsive, but without developing vomiting, diarrhea or apparent respiratory illness. Ebola virus was detected in their blood, and genetic fragments of Ebola were found in their nose, mouth and rectum, but no intact infectious Ebola virus was found in their nose, mouth or rectum by tissue culture. Control cynomolgus monkeys were caged 1 foot away from the infected rhesus monkeys but did not become infected with Ebola. This experiment is not a helpful comparison for human to human Ebola infections which are characterized by GI (vomiting & diarrhea) and respiratory (cough and expectoration of sputum) shedding of the intact infectious virus. The monkeys in this year's study simply died too fast, not allowing time for them to shed infectious Ebola particles. It goes without saying that monkeys which do not shed infectious Ebola particles cannot transmit Ebola to other monkeys. Had this year's rhesus monkeys been infected by the nasal route, as was the case in a pig to monkey experiment in 2012, or if they had lived up to 13 days as in the 1995 study, allowing time for intact infectious Ebola virus to appear in their nose, mouth and rectum, and thus more closely matching human Ebola disease, then it is likely we would have once again seen monkey to monkey airborne transmission of Ebola.

 Despite reassurances from professional groups, some patients remain uneasy. Nancy Sander, president of the Allergy and Asthma Network-Mothers of Asthmatics, a patient advocacy group with 5,000 members based in Fairfax, Va., said that the current F.D.A. proposal reflected more concern for the environment than for people with asthma. Surveys indicate that patients favor the development of new inhalers and the elimination of CFC's, she said, but they fear that the process the F.D.A. has suggested may phase out the old ones without first letting patients make sure that the new ones work as well. Ms. Sander also said patients were worried that some old medications would not be reformulated into new inhalers because of the expense of the change and would be lost from the market. ''The F.D.A. needs to continue to understand the needs of patients and to monitor them the same way the Environmental Protection Agency monitors ozone,'' she said. The proposed changes are intended to bring the United States into compliance with the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty signed by more than 150 countries to reduce CFC pollution. In keeping with the treaty, the production of the gases was banned for most nonmedical uses in the United States in 1996. Inhaled medications received an ''essential use'' exemption from the treaty because they form the cornerstone of treatment for most of the 12 million to 15 million people with asthma in the nation and a similar number with disorders like emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

 The United States is seeking to make more American farmers and industries exempt from an international ban on methyl bromide, a popular pesticide that damages Earth's protective ozone layer, Bush administration officials said yesterday. Last year, the administration sought to exclude a variety of farmers and food producers from the ban, which takes effect next year that outlaws substances that harm the ozone layer. The exempt businesses would be allowed 21.9 million pounds of methyl bromide next year and 20.8 million pounds in 2006 in uses like fumigating stored grain and treating golf-course sod and strawberry fields. The new request, filed with United Nations treaty administrators last weekend, would add 1.1 million pounds to the 2005 request, to be used by producers of cut flowers, processed meats and tobacco seedlings. Some American growers say methyl bromide remains vital to compete with countries where cheap laborers do weeding and pest control. Critics of the American requests said the exemptions could undermine the 1987 ozone treaty. Use of methyl bromide has been cut 70 percent in industrialized countries since 1999 under the treaty. Parties to the pact, the Montreal Protocol, are to meet this month in Montreal to consider requests by the United States and other countries.

 But most of the delegates and observers here said they were optimistic that the protocol would be adopted and ratified.

The proposed treaty deals with chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, chemicals used in refrigeration, air conditioning, plastic foams, aerosol sprays, cleaning agents for electronic products and a wide variety of other products. Their use in aerosol sprays has been banned in the United States. The draft protocol would freeze consumption by developed countries at 1986 levels starting Jan. 1, 1990; it would reduce consumption by 20 percent by Jan. 1, 1994, and by as much as an additional 30 percent by Jan. 1, 1999. However, the draft would allow total global production of these chemicals go up by as much as 10 percent over the next 10 years in order to meet the needs of the developing countries for industrial growth. The draft protocol would also freeze consumption of halons, chemicals used as fire supressants, by Jan. 1, 1994, but would not require any rollbacks in their use. Dire Predictions Both CFC's and halons combine chemically with and destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere. That ozone shields the earth's surface from ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

 The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1989, shows how science and policy can work hand in hand.

 Stratospheric ozone exists in a delicate chemical balance, which may be threatened by a group of manufactured chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons. They are used as refrigerants in aerosol spray cans and in producing some plastics. It is necessary that we protect the good ozone. The protection of stratospheric ozone is clearly a global task. It affects life on the entire planet. The problem was addressed last year at an international conference in Montreal that was attended by 24 nations, including the United States and the Soviet Union.

 The 1987 Montreal protocol on the ozone layer, now endorsed by 177 countries, is an example that is being overlooked. Its success did not come from its initial 1987 controls on the use of chemicals that deplete ozone, but from its adaptability in achieving its goals. The flexibility of the Montreal protocol made it easier for industry and governments to accept firm goals in the first place, making it possible for the world to move in a common direction.

 The protocol would freeze all consumption of chlorofluorocarbons at levels prevailing in 1986. The freeze would take effect by Jan. 1, 1990. An exception was allowed for the Soviet Union, which would be permitted to freeze at levels prevailing in 1990, when its five-year plan expires. Chlorofluorocarbon consumption would then be rolled back by 20 percent by 1994 and an additional 30 percent by 1999. But global production of the chemicals would be permitted to rise as much as 10 percent over 10 years in order to meet the needs of developing countries for industrial growth. European Community a Hurdle Halon consumption levels would be frozen by 1994, but no rollbacks are planned for these chemicals yet. The major last-minute hurdle faced by the negotiators was a demand by the European Community that its 12 member nations be treated as a single entity and that consumption limits not apply to any one member country. Mr. Thomas said the United States objected to this plan because it would give the European Community a trade advantage not enjoyed by others joining in the protocol. A compromise was reached that would allow the Community to be treated individually, but only after each member state ratified the protocol individually.

 In 1987 scientists were astonished to find that the ozone over the South Polar region declined by 50 percent. Scientists concluded that the industrial chemicals, reacting chemically on the crystalline surfaces of polar clouds, formed chemically active chlorine and bromine molecules that destroyed ozone over Antarctica.

Tip #2 - If you have a car; get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park. Tip #3 - Learn a bit of French. A great book which has a lot of basic phrases and fun things to try is Rick Steves' handy pocketbook guide to basic French (find book) Tip #4 - Use the Metro (the subway). There is simply no better way to get around Paris. But make sure you've brushed up on your French. It will help with buying tickets and understanding the maps in the subways. Tip #5 - The lines and crowds at the Eiffel Tower can get very long. If you must see the lights of Paris at night (and you should) Go on a week night (not Friday); or make reservations. TIP #6 - The Louvre. From what I understand; if you are an art lover and really appreciate art museums; you could spend weeks there; but for most people; half a day is enough time. You see the famous pictures (Mona Lisa); and spend some time looking at the amazing art. if you go on Sunday morning and get there as they're opening; it's free admission. TIP # 7 - If there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in Paris; it's in the roundabout that goes around the Arc D'Triomphe. If you rent a car and drive here; just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules. TIP #8 - There are lots of wonderful museums in France! One of them is the Pantheon; which was originally a church; and originally planned to be something other than that .Victor Hugo and some other famous French people are buried there. Make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that's something you want to do. TIP #9 - Have some small change (or large change if you can afford it) on hand for the street performers. They're pretty good! TIP #10 - If you like looking at the inside of churches; take some time for Notre' Dame; and if you have a problem with crowds; don't go on the weekend. People were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays; but there are a lot of people there on the weekends; so you end up waiting in line; and it gets more noisy inside. TIP #11 - If you want to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle at night; get there right before the hour. TIP #12 - If you see a person on the street who is selling something and wants to sketch you or give you something for free; don't be fooled by talk which says they'll so something for free.

Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar,I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica.

Drinking milk after eating prawns,Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits...like: # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat; fish; yoghurt; cheese; buttermilk and fromage frais. # Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water; or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit. # Avoid reheated or stale food. # Most of one's food should be cooked; as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad). # Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty; but support the digestive processes as well. # Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet; sour; salty; pungent; bitter; and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology. # During meals you may sip liquids such as water; juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes. # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal.

Drinking milk after eating prawns,Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together; it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items. Don't eat grain; cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits; grapes; pineapple etc. Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy; carbohydrate rich food items. Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal; independent of other regular meals. Milk and meat is bad combination. Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together; it becomes toxic. Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule. Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable. Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayur.....,0.06217616580310881

 Rudolf Hess, the onetime deputy to Hitler who early in World War II parachuted into a Scottish meadow in what he called an attempt to make peace between Nazi Germany and Britain, died yesterday in West Berlin. He was 93 years old. Hess, once one of Hitler's designated successors, was the last survivor of the 19 German officials convicted by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946. Given a life sentence, he had been an inmate of Spandau Prison in West Berlin since 1947; for the last two decades, Hess had been Spandau's only occupant.

 The difference between Rudolf Hess and Kurt Waldheim, you say in your editorial on the death of Rudolf Hess (''Spandau's Prisoner No. 7,'' Aug. 18), is ''that Hess was a powerless symbol, and Mr. Waldheim is President of Austria.'' This leads to perversion of history. Hess was Hitler's deputy 50 years ago, and Kurt Waldheim became President of Austria 50 years later. The difference is that as Hitler's deputy, Hess was a mature man in a powerful and influential position, whereas Mr. Waldheim was an unimportant lieutenant, perhaps 25 years old
